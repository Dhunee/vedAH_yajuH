## Witzel संस्करणम्
- Lib genesis इत्यत्र witzel-संस्करणं लभ्यते दुःपठरीत्या। 

> A good half of the book is a translation of the thesis of Prof. Witzel and the German original. Note that although it's called a critical edition, it's based on a single manuscript. There are some good color photographs of the bark manuscript. Only the pravargya and its brAhmaNa are to be found in this book. Although the aruNa-prashna and svAdhyAyabrAhmaNa of the taittiriya are originally from the kaTha-shAkhA, these cannot be found in this manuscript. Whether this is one of the kaTha-shAkhA-s which had only these two in its ArNyakam or whether these fragments are the only ones available from a bigger AraNyakam is only a matter of speculation. BTW, at $50, this is one of the cheaper books to be found in the HOS.
