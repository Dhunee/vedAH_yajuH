> The occurrence of “gandharva” in this śloka of the Vāyupurāṇa may not be a textual corruption, in light of this mantra & its brãhmaṇa from the Kaṭhāraṇyakam, which identifies Rudra as the Gandharva-Bhuvanapati.

The lost parts of the kaTha tradition, which was once practiced kashmIra, pA~nchanada & gandhAra also had distinctive rudrian material, e.g., [Yajus incantations for the worship of Rudra from the Kāṭhaka](https://manasataramgini.wordpress.com/2020/12/27/yajus-incantations-for-the-worship-of-rudra-from-the-kaṭhaka-ritual-manuals/)

The above cited brAhmaNa comes just before the famous brAhmaNa section on the arrival of rudra in svarga and the deva-s pacifying him. The frame of this brAhmaNa was later used in the atharvashiras. That kaTha-s used the AV-like rudra (linked in first twt) to their shatarudrIya is suggested by this AraNyaka in the pravargya context: it has a brAhmaNa on the ending of the shatarudrIya combined with the AV-rudra-like  mantra-s: "namo rudrAya diviShade yasaya varSham iShavaH"

In the shatarudrIya in plural:

> namo astu rudrebhyo ye divi  
> yeShAM varSham iShavas  
> tebhyo dasha prAchIr  
> dasha dakShiNA  
> dasha pratIchIr  
> dashodIchIr  
> dashordhvAs  
> tebhyo namo astu  
> te no mR^iDayantu  
> te yaM dviShmo yash cha no dveShTi  
> tam eShAM jambhe dadhAmi |

Regarding the above it states: 

> varShaM vA eSha iShUH kR^itvA  
> prajA hinasti  
> yadograM varShati |  
> tasmai nama iti  
> varSham eva shivaM karoti |  
> tena mA sam ara iti  
> mA sambAdhe samAgamAmetye+++(=??-)+++ vai tad Aha |

the "tena mA sam ara.." correspond to the AV-like mantra:  

> rudreNAdhvaghAtinA  
> tena mA sam arAmahi |

The kaTha-s also have a peculiar identification of rudra & puShan keeping with their functional overlap seen in terms like puShTipati & pashupat; thus it says:

> puShNa AghR^iNaye svAhA+ iti pa~nchAhutIr juhoti |  
> pUShA vai rudro  
> rudra AghR^iNir  
> etAni vai rudrasya ugrANi nAmAni ||
