### p
Drive away the foe, the enemy,  
Smash the jaws of Vrtra;  
In rage do thou avert the anger  
Of him who is hostile to us.
### q
The guardian Indra, the helper Indra,  
The hero ready to hear at every call, Indra,  
I invoke the strong one, invoked of many, Indra;  
May Indra in his bounty bestow on us prosperity
### r
May we not [5], O strong one, in this distress,  
Be handed over to evil, O lord of the ways;  
Guard us with true protection;  
May we be dear to you among the princes.
### s
The Anus have wrought a chariot for thy steed;  
Tvastr a glorious bolt, O thou invoked of many;  
The Brahmans magnifying Indra with their praises  
Have strengthened him for the slaying of the serpent.
### t
What time the strong sang praise to the strong,  
O Indra, the stones and Aditi in unison,  
Without steeds or chariots were the fellies  
Which, sped by Indra, rolled against the Dasyus.
