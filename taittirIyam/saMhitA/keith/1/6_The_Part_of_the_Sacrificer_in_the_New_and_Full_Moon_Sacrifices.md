### a
Indra for you we invoke  
On all sides from other men;  
Be he ours only.
### a
Indra men call in reverence  
That he may cause their prayers to be accomplished; Hero, men overpowering, delighting in strength, Do thou confer upon us a stall full of kine.
### c
O Çatakratu, the strength of thine  
That is in the five folks,  
That do I choose of thee.
### d
To thee hath been assigned for mighty power,  
For ever, in the slaying of Vrtra,  
All lordship, and all strength, O thou that art worthy of sacrifice In the overcoming of man, by the gods, O Indra [1].
### c
In whom the seven Vasavas rest  
As it were firm rooted,  
The Rsi of farthest hearing,  
The glowing pot is the guest of Indra.
### f
In the raw thou didst produce the cooked,  
And madest the sun to mount in the sky;  
Like the glowing pot heat ye the Saman  
With good prayers, delightful to the lover of song.
### g
Indra the singers aloud,  
Indra with praises the praisers,  
Indra the songs have praised.
### h
The singers sing thee [2];  
The praisers hymn thy praise;  
The Brahmans raise thee,  
0 Çatakratu, like a pole.
### i
Let us offer our praise to him who delivereth from trouble, Swiftest to give, celebrating his loving kindness; O Indra, accept this oblation;  
May the desires of the sacrificer be fulfilled.
### k
That to which Dhisana impelled me have I produced; I shall praise Indra before the decisive day;  
Him that goeth as with a ship  
Both parties invoke that there he may rescue us.
### l
First lord of sacrifices [3],  
Freeing from trouble, the best of those worthy of offering, Son of the waters, the impeller, O ye Aśvins;  
Do ye confer power and strength on this one.
### m
Smite away our foes, O Indra;  
Cast down the warriors;  
Make him low  
Who is hostile to us.
### n
O Indra, thou wast born for rule, for prosperous strength Of the people, O strong one;  
Thou didst smite away the unfriendly folk,  
And madest wide room for the gods.
### o
Like a dread beast, evil, roaming the mountains, He hath come from the furthest place [4];  
Sharpening thy lance, thy sharp edge, O Indra,  
Smite the foes, drive away the enemy.
### p
Drive away the foe, the enemy,
  
Smash the jaws of Vrtra;  
In rage do thou avert the anger  
Of him who is hostile to us.
### q
The guardian Indra, the helper Indra,  
The hero ready to hear at every call, Indra,  
I invoke the strong one, invoked of many, Indra;  
May Indra in his bounty bestow on us prosperity
### r
May we not [5], O strong one, in this distress,  
Be handed over to evil, O lord of the ways;  
Guard us with true protection;  
May we be dear to you among the princes.
### s
The Anus have wrought a chariot for thy steed;  
Tvastr a glorious bolt, O thou invoked of many;  
The Brahmans magnifying Indra with their praises  
Have strengthened him for the slaying of the serpent.
### t
What time the strong sang praise to the strong,  
O Indra, the stones and Aditi in unison,  
Without steeds or chariots were the fellies  
Which, sped by Indra, rolled against the Dasyus.
