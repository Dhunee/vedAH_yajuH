verily he makes him an eater of food. 'This blessing I invoke bringing light for the race', he should say, who has no son born; verily is born to him a son brilliant and resplendent. 'This blessing I invoke bringing light for N. N.', he should say who has a son born; verily he confers upon him brilliance and splendour.

He offers the Agnihotra; whatever there is. of the Sacrificer's own, that is (still) his. In the generative organ he pours seed, for Agni is the generative organ. Then he burns at the end the plants; they then grow more numerous. In that he offers in the evening, he thus pours seed, and
  
makes it productive by the morning (offering). Seed when poured does not prove fruitful unless modified by Tvastr; as many modifications of seed when poured [1] as Tvastr makes, in so many shapes does it become fruitful; the sacrificer is the divine Tvastr. He pays reverence with many (verses); verily he makes many modifications of the seed when poured. He is fruitful and day by day becomes greater, who knowing thus pays reverence to the fire. The day was the gods', the night the Asuras'. The Asuras entered night with all the precious wealth of the gods [2]; the gods thought that they were abandoned; they perceived, 'The night is Agni's, cattle are Agni's; verily let us praise Agni here; he being praised by us will restore our cattle.' They praised Agni; be praised by them delivered their cattle from night to day; the gods having gained their cattle per formed their desires. He who knowing thus pays reverence to the fire becomes possessed of cattle [3]. The sun went from this world to yonder world; he having gone to yonder world bethought him again of this world; having returned to this world he had fear of death, for this world is, as it were, yoked with death. He reflected, 'Let me praise Agni here; he, praised, will make me go to the world of heaven.' He praised Agni; he, praised, made him go to the world of heaven. He who [4] knowing thus pays reverence to the fire, goes to the world of heaven and lives all his days. He mounts these two fires who pays reverence to them; he acts according to the desires of one who has attained a higher place. He pays reverence at night, not in the morning, for vows are mingled at night, the bad and the good are on the same level, the fire is the light, the evening is the darkness; in that [5] he pays reverence by night, he overcomes the darkness by light. 'Should reverence be paid to the fire or not?' they say; 'he who day by day makes a present to a man and then begs of him assuredly molests him; and who then will day by day beg of the gods?' Then they say, 'The sacrificer sacrifices for the sake of the benediction.' The reverence of the fire is [6] the benediction of him who has established a fire; therefore reverence should be paid to the fire. Prajapati created cattle; being created they entered day and night; he recovered them by means of the metres. In that he pays reverence with the metres, he seeks to recover his own. 'There is not monotony then', they say, 'if one pays reverence day by day.' If a man pays reverence to the fire facing it, it burns him; if with averted (face), he is deprived of offspring and cattle; he should pay reverence with (face) somewhat to the side, then (the fire) does not burn him, he is not deprived of offspring or cattle.

### a
The name that first, O alI-knower,  
My father and my mother bestowed upon me aforetime,  
Do thou bear it until I return;  
O Agni, may I bear thy name.
### b
My name and thine, O all-knower,  
Which like men changing garments we bear,  
Let us exchange again,  
Thou for life, and we to live.
### c
Homage to Agni, the unpierced,  
Homage to the unapproachable, homage to the king!  
Irresistible is Agni [1], the very vigorous, all-conquering,  
Powerful, the best, the Gandharva.
### d
O Agni, the gods have thee for father,  
Offer to thee oblations, and have thee as an umpire  
With life, with lordship of cattle (endow) me  
And bestow on me good fortune.
### e
Agni here is of all the best,  
He is most adorable,  
Must ready to win (us) a thousand;  
To him be all good strength.
### f
Mind, light, rejoice in the oblation  
May he unite the scattered sacrifice;  
The offerings at dawn and evening  
I unite with oblation and ghee.

### g
Rich in milk are the plants [2],  
The milk of the shoot is rich in milk,  
With the milk of the milk of the waters,  
O Indra, do thou unite me.
### h
O Agni, lord of vows, I shall perform this vow; may I accomplish it; may it be successful for me.
### i
Agni, the priest, I summon hither;  
The gods worthy of sacrifice whom we invoke,  
Let these gods come in kindly mind;  
Let the gods enjoy this oblation of me.
### k
Who yoketh thee? Let him yoke thee.
### l
The potsherds for the cauldron [3],  
Which wise men collect,  
These are in Pusan's guardianship;  
Indra and Vayu set them free.
### m
Unbroken is the cauldron, sprinkling abundantly,  
It hath returned to that whence it came;  
The kindling-wood, the Vedi, and all the enclosing-sticks  
Attend the life of the sacrifice.
### n
The three and thirty threads that stretch,  
That maintain in security the sacrifice,  
Of these the broken one I restore; hail!  
Let the cauldron go to the gods.

### a
Let Vaiśvanara with succour for us  
Come from afar,  
Agni through the hymn which brings (him).
### b
The righteous Vaiśvanara,  
Lord of right and of light,  
The immortal cauldron we seek.'
### c
A greater than the marvels of Vaiśvanara  
By his craftsmanship the sage hath performed alone;  
Magnifying both parents, sky and earth,  
Rich in seed, was Agni born.
### d
Desired in the sky, Agni, desired on earth,  
Desired he entereth all the plants;  
Agni Vaiśvanara eagerly desired,  
May he by day [1] and night protect us from the foe.
### e
In that, when born, O Agni, thou didst survey the worlds,  
Like a busy herd that goeth around his flock,  
Do thou, O Vaiśvanara, find a way for the Brahman;  
Do ye protect us ever with your blessings.
### f
Thou, O Agni, blazing with light,  
Didst fill the firmament at thy birth;  
Thou, O Vaiśvanara, wise one, by thy might  
Didst free the gods from misfortune.'
### g
O Agni, among our bountiful lords, preserve  
The lordship, uninjured, unageing, rich in heroes;  
May we win booty a hundred, a thousandfold,  
O Vaiśvanara [2], O Agni, through thy help.
### h
May we enjoy the loving kindness of Vaiśvanara,  
For he is the king, the orderer of the worlds  
Hence born be discerneth all the (earth),  
Vaiśvanara vieth with the sun.

### i
Thine anger, O Varuna, would we avert with reverence,  
With sacrifices, with oblations  
Ruling, O wise Asura, O king,  
Do thou unloose the sins we have committed.
### k
Unloose from us, O Varuna, the highest,  
The lowest, the midmost knot;  
Then may we, O Aditya [3], in thy rule,  
Be guiltless before Aditi.  
I Of Dadhikravan have I sung,  
The swift strong horse;  
May he make our mouths fragrant;  
May he lengthen our days.
### m
Dadhikra with his glory hath overspread the five peoples,  
As the sun with his light the waters;  
May the strong steed, winning a hundred, a thousand,  
Fill with boney these words of ours.
### n
Agni, the head.
### o
Thou art.
### p
O Maruts, what time seeking your favour  
We call on you from the sky,  
Do ye come unto us [4].
### q
The protections which ye have for the earnest worshipper,  
Threefold do ye grant them to the generous giver,  
To us, O Maruts, do ye accord them;  
O strong ones, give us wealth rich in heroes:
### r
Let Aditi save us,  
Let Aditi give us protection,  
Let Aditi guard us from tribulation.
### s
The mighty mother of the righteous,  
The spouse of holy order, let us invoke to aid us,  
The powerful, the unageing, the wide  
Aditi, who giveth good protection and good guidance.
### t
Earth strong to save, sky unrivalled,  
Aditi who giveth good protection and good guidance,  
The divine ship with good oars, the blameless,  
Which leaketh not, let us mount for prosperity.
### u
Happily have I mounted this ship  
With a hundred oars and a hundred spars,  
Without leak, able to convey across.
