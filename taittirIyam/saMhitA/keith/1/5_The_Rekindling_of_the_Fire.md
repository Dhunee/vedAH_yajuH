Let Aditi save us,  
Let Aditi give us protection,  
Let Aditi guard us from tribulation.
### s
The mighty mother of the righteous,  
The spouse of holy order, let us invoke to aid us,  
The powerful, the unageing, the wide  
Aditi, who giveth good protection and good guidance.
### t
Earth strong to save, sky unrivalled,  
Aditi who giveth good protection and good guidance,  
The divine ship with good oars, the blameless,  
Which leaketh not, let us mount for prosperity.
### u
Happily have I mounted this ship  
With a hundred oars and a hundred spars,  
Without leak, able to convey across.
