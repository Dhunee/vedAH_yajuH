### a
The name that first, O alI-knower,  
My father and my mother bestowed upon me aforetime,  
Do thou bear it until I return;  
O Agni, may I bear thy name.
### b
My name and thine, O all-knower,  
Which like men changing garments we bear,  
Let us exchange again,  
Thou for life, and we to live.
### c
Homage to Agni, the unpierced,  
Homage to the unapproachable, homage to the king!  
Irresistible is Agni [1], the very vigorous, all-conquering,  
Powerful, the best, the Gandharva.
### d
O Agni, the gods have thee for father,  
Offer to thee oblations, and have thee as an umpire  
With life, with lordship of cattle (endow) me  
And bestow on me good fortune.
### e
Agni here is of all the best,  
He is most adorable,  
Must ready to win (us) a thousand;  
To him be all good strength.
### f
Mind, light, rejoice in the oblation  
May he unite the scattered sacrifice;  
The offerings at dawn and evening  
I unite with oblation and ghee.

### g
Rich in milk are the plants [2],  
The milk of the shoot is rich in milk,  
With the milk of the milk of the waters,  
O Indra, do thou unite me.
### h
O Agni, lord of vows, I shall perform this vow; may I accomplish it; may it be successful for me.
### i
Agni, the priest, I summon hither;  
The gods worthy of sacrifice whom we invoke,  
Let these gods come in kindly mind;  
Let the gods enjoy this oblation of me.
### k
Who yoketh thee? Let him yoke thee.
### l
The potsherds for the cauldron [3],  
Which wise men collect,  
These are in Pusan's guardianship;  
Indra and Vayu set them free.
### m
Unbroken is the cauldron, sprinkling abundantly,  
It hath returned to that whence it came;  
The kindling-wood, the Vedi, and all the enclosing-sticks  
Attend the life of the sacrifice.
### n
The three and thirty threads that stretch,  
That maintain in security the sacrifice,  
Of these the broken one I restore; hail!  
Let the cauldron go to the gods.

### a
Let Vaiśvanara with succour for us  
Come from afar,  
Agni through the hymn which brings (him).
### b
The righteous Vaiśvanara,  
Lord of right and of light,  
The immortal cauldron we seek.'
### c
A greater than the marvels of Vaiśvanara  
By his craftsmanship the sage hath performed alone;  
Magnifying both parents, sky and earth,  
Rich in seed, was Agni born.
### d
Desired in the sky, Agni, desired on earth,  
Desired he entereth all the plants;  
Agni Vaiśvanara eagerly desired,  
May he by day [1] and night protect us from the foe.
### e
In that, when born, O Agni, thou didst survey the worlds,  
Like a busy herd that goeth around his flock,  
Do thou, O Vaiśvanara, find a way for the Brahman;  
Do ye protect us ever with your blessings.
### f
Thou, O Agni, blazing with light,  
Didst fill the firmament at thy birth;  
Thou, O Vaiśvanara, wise one, by thy might  
Didst free the gods from misfortune.'
### g
O Agni, among our bountiful lords, preserve  
The lordship, uninjured, unageing, rich in heroes;  
May we win booty a hundred, a thousandfold,  
O Vaiśvanara [2], O Agni, through thy help.
### h
May we enjoy the loving kindness of Vaiśvanara,  
For he is the king, the orderer of the worlds  
Hence born be discerneth all the (earth),  
Vaiśvanara vieth with the sun.

### i
Thine anger, O Varuna, would we avert with reverence,  
With sacrifices, with oblations  
Ruling, O wise Asura, O king,  
Do thou unloose the sins we have committed.
### k
Unloose from us, O Varuna, the highest,  
The lowest, the midmost knot;  
Then may we, O Aditya [3], in thy rule,  
Be guiltless before Aditi.  
I Of Dadhikravan have I sung,  
The swift strong horse;  
May he make our mouths fragrant;  
May he lengthen our days.
### m
Dadhikra with his glory hath overspread the five peoples,  
As the sun with his light the waters;  
May the strong steed, winning a hundred, a thousand,  
Fill with boney these words of ours.
### n
Agni, the head.
### o
Thou art.
### p
O Maruts, what time seeking your favour  
We call on you from the sky,  
Do ye come unto us [4].
### q
The protections which ye have for the earnest worshipper,  
Threefold do ye grant them to the generous giver,  
To us, O Maruts, do ye accord them;  
O strong ones, give us wealth rich in heroes:
### r
Let Aditi save us,  
Let Aditi give us protection,  
Let Aditi guard us from tribulation.
### s
The mighty mother of the righteous,  
The spouse of holy order, let us invoke to aid us,  
The powerful, the unageing, the wide  
Aditi, who giveth good protection and good guidance.
### t
Earth strong to save, sky unrivalled,  
Aditi who giveth good protection and good guidance,  
The divine ship with good oars, the blameless,  
Which leaketh not, let us mount for prosperity.
### u
Happily have I mounted this ship  
With a hundred oars and a hundred spars,  
Without leak, able to convey across.
