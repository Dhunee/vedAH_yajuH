Thou, O Agni, blazing with light,  
Didst fill the firmament at thy birth;  
Thou, O Vaiśvanara, wise one, by thy might  
Didst free the gods from misfortune.'
### g
O Agni, among our bountiful lords, preserve  
The lordship, uninjured, unageing, rich in heroes;  
May we win booty a hundred, a thousandfold,  
O Vaiśvanara [2], O Agni, through thy help.
### h
May we enjoy the loving kindness of Vaiśvanara,  
For he is the king, the orderer of the worlds  
Hence born be discerneth all the (earth),  
Vaiśvanara vieth with the sun.

### i
Thine anger, O Varuna, would we avert with reverence,  
With sacrifices, with oblations  
Ruling, O wise Asura, O king,  
Do thou unloose the sins we have committed.
### k
Unloose from us, O Varuna, the highest,  
The lowest, the midmost knot;  
Then may we, O Aditya [3], in thy rule,  
Be guiltless before Aditi.  
I Of Dadhikravan have I sung,  
The swift strong horse;  
May he make our mouths fragrant;  
May he lengthen our days.
### m
Dadhikra with his glory hath overspread the five peoples,  
As the sun with his light the waters;  
May the strong steed, winning a hundred, a thousand,  
Fill with boney these words of ours.
### n
Agni, the head.
### o
Thou art.
### p
O Maruts, what time seeking your favour  
We call on you from the sky,  
Do ye come unto us [4].
### q
The protections which ye have for the earnest worshipper,  
Threefold do ye grant them to the generous giver,  
To us, O Maruts, do ye accord them;  
O strong ones, give us wealth rich in heroes:
### r
Let Aditi save us,  
Let Aditi give us protection,  
Let Aditi guard us from tribulation.
### s
The mighty mother of the righteous,  
The spouse of holy order, let us invoke to aid us,  
The powerful, the unageing, the wide  
Aditi, who giveth good protection and good guidance.
### t
Earth strong to save, sky unrivalled,  
Aditi who giveth good protection and good guidance,  
The divine ship with good oars, the blameless,  
Which leaketh not, let us mount for prosperity.
### u
Happily have I mounted this ship  
With a hundred oars and a hundred spars,  
Without leak, able to convey across.
