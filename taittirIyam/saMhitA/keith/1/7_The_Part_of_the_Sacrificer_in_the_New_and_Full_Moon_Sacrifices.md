All hearken to our cry.

Strong limbed, winning a thousand,  
Eager to gain in the gaining of praise,  
The steeds, which have won in the contests great prizes,  
May they be propitious to us when we call.

Among the gods, strong limbed, good praisers,  
Destroying the serpent, the wolf, the Raksases,  
For ever may they remove from us evil [2].  
1 This steed speedeth his swift course,  
Bound at the neck, the shoulder, and the mouth;  
Displaying his strength Dadhikra  
Springeth along the bends of the ways.
### m
After him as he hasteneth in triumphant speed  
Bloweth the wind as after the wing of the bird,  
Of the impetuous eagle, (after him) Dadhikravan,  
As in his might he crosseth the winding ways.
### n
May there come to me the instigation of strength;  
May there come sky and earth with all healing;  
Come to me father [3] and mother;  
May Soma come to me for immortality.

That ye did make with Indra.

All lordship, and all strength, O thou that art worthy of sacrifice  
In the overcoming of man by the gods, O Indra,
### c
Indrani beyond other women  
I have heard to be favoured with a spouse,  
For never at any time [1]  
Shall her husband die of old age.
### d
I have not joyed, O Indrani,  
Without my friend Vrsakapi,  
Whose oblation rich in water  
Goeth dear to the gods.

He who first born in his wisdom  
A god, surpassed the gods in insight,  
From whose breath the sky and earth recoiled,  
In the greatness of his manhood, he, O ye men, is Indra.
### f
Hitherward be thy might with aid, O dread Indra,  
What time the armies meet in combat,  
And the arrow flieth from the arms of the strong men;  
Let not thine [2] anger spread on every side.
### g
Destroy us not; bring and give to us  
That plenteous bounty which thou hast to give to the pious man,  
For this new gift, this song we have sung to thee;  
Let us speak forth in praise of Indra.

Bring it to us, let none intercept it;
  
For we know thee as wealth lord of riches;  
That mighty gift of thine, O Indra,  
Vouchsafe it us, O lord of the bay steeds [3].

With our oblation we summon  
1ndra, the giver;  
Fill both thy hands with bounty;  
Give to us from the left and the right.
### k
The giver, the bolt-bearer, the bull, the overpowering,  
The impetuous, the king, slayer of Vrtra, drinker of the Soma,  
Seated at this sacrifice on the strew,  
Be thou health and wealth to the sacrificer.
### l
Indra, the protector, the granter of aid with his aids;  
All knowing, be kindly to us;  
Let him restrain the enemy, let him make security,  
May we be lords of strength [4].

May we enjoy the favour of him the worshipful,  
And also his loving kindness;  
May the protector Indra, the granter of aid,  
For ever fend far from us the enemy.
### n
Rich banquets be ours with Indra,  
With mighty strength,  
Wherewith fed we may be glad.
### o
To Indra, here sing strength  
To place his chariot in the front;  
Even in conflict in battle he maketh wide room;  
Slayer of foes in the contests  
Be thou our comforter;  
Let the feeble bowstrings  
Of the others break on their bows.
