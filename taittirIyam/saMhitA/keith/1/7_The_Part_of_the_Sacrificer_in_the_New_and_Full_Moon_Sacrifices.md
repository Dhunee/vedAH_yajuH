### a
The months, the woods,  
The plants, the mountains,  
The earth and sky in longing,  
The waters, followed Indra on his birth.
### b
To thee hath been assigned for mighty power,  
For ever, in the slaying of Vrtra,  
All lordship, and all strength, O thou that art worthy of sacrifice  
In the overcoming of man by the gods, O Indra,
### c
Indrani beyond other women  
I have heard to be favoured with a spouse,  
For never at any time [1]  
Shall her husband die of old age.
### d
I have not joyed, O Indrani,  
Without my friend Vrsakapi,  
Whose oblation rich in water  
Goeth dear to the gods.
### e
He who first born in his wisdom  
A god, surpassed the gods in insight,  
From whose breath the sky and earth recoiled,  
In the greatness of his manhood, he, O ye men, is Indra.
### f
Hitherward be thy might with aid, O dread Indra,  
What time the armies meet in combat,  
And the arrow flieth from the arms of the strong men;  
Let not thine [2] anger spread on every side.
### g
Destroy us not; bring and give to us  
That plenteous bounty which thou hast to give to the pious man,  
For this new gift, this song we have sung to thee;  
Let us speak forth in praise of Indra.
### h
Bring it to us, let none intercept it;
  
For we know thee as wealth lord of riches;  
That mighty gift of thine, O Indra,  
Vouchsafe it us, O lord of the bay steeds [3].
### i
With our oblation we summon  
1ndra, the giver;  
Fill both thy hands with bounty;  
Give to us from the left and the right.
### k
The giver, the bolt-bearer, the bull, the overpowering,  
The impetuous, the king, slayer of Vrtra, drinker of the Soma,  
Seated at this sacrifice on the strew,  
Be thou health and wealth to the sacrificer.
### l
Indra, the protector, the granter of aid with his aids;  
All knowing, be kindly to us;  
Let him restrain the enemy, let him make security,  
May we be lords of strength [4].
### m
May we enjoy the favour of him the worshipful,  
And also his loving kindness;  
May the protector Indra, the granter of aid,  
For ever fend far from us the enemy.
### n
Rich banquets be ours with Indra,  
With mighty strength,  
Wherewith fed we may be glad.
### o
To Indra, here sing strength  
To place his chariot in the front;  
Even in conflict in battle he maketh wide room;  
Slayer of foes in the contests  
Be thou our comforter;  
Let the feeble bowstrings  
Of the others break on their bows.
