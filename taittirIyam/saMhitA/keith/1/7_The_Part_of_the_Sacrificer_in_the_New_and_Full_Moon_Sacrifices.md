### f
### g
Destroy us not; bring and give to us  
That plenteous bounty which thou hast to give to the pious man,  
For this new gift, this song we have sung to thee;  
Let us speak forth in praise of Indra.
### h
Bring it to us, let none intercept it;
  
For we know thee as wealth lord of riches;  
That mighty gift of thine, O Indra,  
Vouchsafe it us, O lord of the bay steeds [3].
### i
With our oblation we summon  
1ndra, the giver;  
Fill both thy hands with bounty;  
Give to us from the left and the right.
### k
The giver, the bolt-bearer, the bull, the overpowering,  
The impetuous, the king, slayer of Vrtra, drinker of the Soma,  
Seated at this sacrifice on the strew,  
Be thou health and wealth to the sacrificer.
### l
Indra, the protector, the granter of aid with his aids;  
All knowing, be kindly to us;  
Let him restrain the enemy, let him make security,  
May we be lords of strength [4].
### m
May we enjoy the favour of him the worshipful,  
And also his loving kindness;  
May the protector Indra, the granter of aid,  
For ever fend far from us the enemy.
### n
Rich banquets be ours with Indra,  
With mighty strength,  
Wherewith fed we may be glad.
### o
To Indra, here sing strength  
To place his chariot in the front;  
Even in conflict in battle he maketh wide room;  
Slayer of foes in the contests  
Be thou our comforter;  
Let the feeble bowstrings  
Of the others break on their bows.
