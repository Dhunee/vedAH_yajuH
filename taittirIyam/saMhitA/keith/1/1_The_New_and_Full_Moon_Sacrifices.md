### g
By the lord of the field  
As by a friend may we win  
What nourishes our kine and horses;  
May he be [2] favourable to such as we are.
### h
O lord of the field, the honey-bearing wave,  
As a cow milk, so for us milk;  
May the lords of right graciously accord us  
That which drops honey and is well purified like ghee.
### i
O Agni, lead us by a fair path to wealth,  
O god, knowing all the ways;  
Keep away from us the sin that makes us wander; We will accord to thee most abundant honour.
### k
We have come to the path of the gods  
To accomplish that which we have power to do;  
Let wise Agni sacrifice [3], let him be Hotr  
Let him arrange the offerings him the seasons.
### l
What carrieth best is for Agni;  
Sing aloud, O thou of brilliant radiance.  
From thee wealth, like a cow,  
From thee strength riseth forth.
### m
O Agni, once more lead us  
With thy favour over every trouble.  
Be a broad, thick, wide fortress for us,  
Health and wealth for our children and descendants. Thou, O Agni, art the guardian of law,  
Among the gods and mortals;  
Thou art to be invoked at the sacrifices.
### o
If laws of you wise ones, O gods,  
In our ignorance we transgress,  
May Agni make good all that,  
He that knoweth the seasons wherein he may satisfy the gods.
