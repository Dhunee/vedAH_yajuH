### a
Ye twain shall be summoned, O Indra and Agni.  
Ye twain shall rejoice together in the offering.  
You both givers of food and riches,  
You both I summon for the winning of strength.
### b
For I have heard that ye both are more generous  
Than a worthless son-in-law or a wife's brother.  
So with the offering of Soma I make for you,  
O 1ndra and Agni, a new hymn of praise;
### c
O Indra and Agni, ninety forts  
Of which the Dasas were lords ye overtbrew  
Together in one deed.
### d
This pure new-born hymn of praise this day,  
O Indra and Agni, slayers of Vrtra, accept with joy [1].  
For on you both I call that are ready to listen,  
You that are ever readiest to give strength to the eager.

### e
We thee, O lord of the path,  
As a chariot to win the prize,  
Have yoked for our prayer, O Pusan.
### f
Lord of each way with eloquence;  
Driven by love he went to Arka;  
May he give us the comfort of gold,  
May Pusan further our every prayer.
### g
By the lord of the field  
As by a friend may we win  
What nourishes our kine and horses;  
May he be [2] favourable to such as we are.
### h
O lord of the field, the honey-bearing wave,  
As a cow milk, so for us milk;  
May the lords of right graciously accord us  
That which drops honey and is well purified like ghee.
### i
O Agni, lead us by a fair path to wealth,  
O god, knowing all the ways;  
Keep away from us the sin that makes us wander; We will accord to thee most abundant honour.
### k
We have come to the path of the gods  
To accomplish that which we have power to do;  
Let wise Agni sacrifice [3], let him be Hotr  
Let him arrange the offerings him the seasons.
### l
What carrieth best is for Agni;  
Sing aloud, O thou of brilliant radiance.  
From thee wealth, like a cow,  
From thee strength riseth forth.
### m
O Agni, once more lead us  
With thy favour over every trouble.  
Be a broad, thick, wide fortress for us,  
Health and wealth for our children and descendants. Thou, O Agni, art the guardian of law,  
Among the gods and mortals;  
Thou art to be invoked at the sacrifices.
### o
If laws of you wise ones, O gods,  
In our ignorance we transgress,  
May Agni make good all that,  
He that knoweth the seasons wherein he may satisfy the gods.
