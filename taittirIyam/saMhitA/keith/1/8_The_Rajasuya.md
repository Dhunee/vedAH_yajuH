O Soma and Rudra, do ye drive away  
The evil spirit that hath entered our abode;  
Far away from us smite misfortune;  
Whatever sin we have done remove from us.

In our bodies, all these medicines;  
Loosen and remove the evil we have done  
That is bound within our bodies.

Begetters, of sky, begetters of earth,  
Born as protectors of the whole world,
