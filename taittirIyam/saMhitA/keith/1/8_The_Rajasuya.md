O Soma and Pusan, begetters of wealth,  
Begetters, of sky, begetters of earth,  
Born as protectors of the whole world,  
The gods have made (you) the navel of immortality.
### r
In the birth of these gods they rejoiced;  
They concealed the hateful darkness;  
Through these two, Soma and Pusan,  
The Indra made the cooked (milk) among the raw cows.
