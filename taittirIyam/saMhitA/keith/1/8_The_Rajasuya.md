Agni for you I honour in song,  
The god first of the bright ones;  
Honouring him who prospereth the fields  
Like a much loved friend.
### l
Swiftly (goeth) the chariot of the worshipper [3]  
Like a hero in every contest;  
He who by sacrifice is fain to win the mind of the gods Shall prevail over those who sacrifice not.
### m
Thou art not harmed, O sacrificer,  
Nor thou, O pourer, nor thou, O pious one;  
There shall be wealth of heroes,  
And plenteousness of swift steeds;  
No one shall in act approach him,  
No one shall anticipate him nor stay him.
### n
Streams, health-bringing, like milch cows,  
Pour up to the man who hath sacrificed and shall sacrifice; Him who filleth and satiateth [4], bringing fame,  
Streams of ghee approach on all sides.
### o
O Soma and Rudra, do ye drive away  
The evil spirit that hath entered our abode;  
Far away from us smite misfortune;  
Whatever sin we have done remove from us.
### p
O Soma and Rudra, do ye give to us,  
In our bodies, all these medicines;  
Loosen and remove the evil we have done  
That is bound within our bodies.
### q
O Soma and Pusan, begetters of wealth,  
Begetters, of sky, begetters of earth,  
Born as protectors of the whole world,  
The gods have made (you) the navel of immortality.
### r
In the birth of these gods they rejoiced;  
They concealed the hateful darkness;  
Through these two, Soma and Pusan,  
The Indra made the cooked (milk) among the raw cows.
