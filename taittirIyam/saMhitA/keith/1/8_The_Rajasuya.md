O Soma and Rudra, do ye drive away  
The evil spirit that hath entered our abode;  
Far away from us smite misfortune;  
Whatever sin we have done remove from us.
### p
O Soma and Rudra, do ye give to us,  
In our bodies, all these medicines;  
Loosen and remove the evil we have done  
That is bound within our bodies.
### q
O Soma and Pusan, begetters of wealth,  
Begetters, of sky, begetters of earth,  
Born as protectors of the whole world,  
The gods have made (you) the navel of immortality.
### r
In the birth of these gods they rejoiced;  
They concealed the hateful darkness;  
Through these two, Soma and Pusan,  
The Indra made the cooked (milk) among the raw cows.
