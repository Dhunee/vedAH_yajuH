What then? As men who have barley  
Reap the barley in order, removing it,  
Hither bring the food of those  
Who have not gone to the reverential cutting of the straw.

O Agni and Visnu, great is your greatness;  
Rejoice ye in the secret names of the ghee;  
Placing in every house seven treasures,  
May your tongue move forth to the ghee.
### b
O Agni and Visnu, great is your dear abode;  
Ye taste the ghee, rejoicing in its secrets;  
In every home increasing lauds,  
May your tongue move forth to the ghee.
### c
May the goddess Sarasvati  
With strength, rich in mares,  
Further us, she that aideth prayer.
### d
To us from the sky, from the great [1] mountain;  
May Sarasvati, the worshipful, come to the sacrifice
  
May the goddess rejoicing in our supplication, rich in ghee, May she hearken gladly to our effectual speech.
### e
O Brhaspati, with the All-gods,  
Do thou rejoice in our oblations;  
Grant riches to the generous giver.
### f
Then to the father, with the All-gods, to the strong one, Let us pay honour with sacrifices, with reverence, with oblations; O Brhaspati, with good offspring, with heroes,  
May we be lords of wealth.
### g
That various wealth bestow upon us,  
O Brhaspati, that shall surpass the enemy,  
That shall shine glorious, with insight among men,  
That shall be resplendent in glory, O thou who art born of holy order [2].
### h
O Mitra and Varuna,  
Bedew our pasturage with ghee  
With mead the regions, O ye wise ones.
### i
Do ye unloose your arms for us to live;  
Do ye bedew our pasturage with ghee;  
Make us famous among the folk, O ye young ones;  
Hearken, O Mitra and Varuna, to these my supplications.
### k
Agni for you I honour in song,  
The god first of the bright ones;  
Honouring him who prospereth the fields  
Like a much loved friend.
### l
Swiftly (goeth) the chariot of the worshipper [3]  
Like a hero in every contest;  
He who by sacrifice is fain to win the mind of the gods Shall prevail over those who sacrifice not.
### m
Thou art not harmed, O sacrificer,  
Nor thou, O pourer, nor thou, O pious one;  
There shall be wealth of heroes,  
And plenteousness of swift steeds;  
No one shall in act approach him,  
No one shall anticipate him nor stay him.
### n
Streams, health-bringing, like milch cows,  
Pour up to the man who hath sacrificed and shall sacrifice; Him who filleth and satiateth [4], bringing fame,  
Streams of ghee approach on all sides.
### o
O Soma and Rudra, do ye drive away  
The evil spirit that hath entered our abode;  
Far away from us smite misfortune;  
Whatever sin we have done remove from us.
### p
O Soma and Rudra, do ye give to us,  
In our bodies, all these medicines;  
Loosen and remove the evil we have done  
That is bound within our bodies.
### q
O Soma and Pusan, begetters of wealth,  
Begetters, of sky, begetters of earth,  
Born as protectors of the whole world,  
The gods have made (you) the navel of immortality.
### r
In the birth of these gods they rejoiced;  
They concealed the hateful darkness;  
Through these two, Soma and Pusan,  
The Indra made the cooked (milk) among the raw cows.
