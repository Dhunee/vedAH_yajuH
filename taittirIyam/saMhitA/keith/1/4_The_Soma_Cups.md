In the sea is thy heart, within the waters;  
Let the plants and the waters enter thee;  
With the offerings of the sacrifice, O lord of the sacrifice,  
Let us worship at the utterance of the hymn, at the utterance of homage.
### f
O bath, O flood, thou glidest, O flood; thou hast removed by sacrifice the sin committed by the gods, through the gods, the sin committed by mortals, through mortals; guard us, O god, from wide hostility.
### g
Be the water and plants friendly to us [2]; be they hostile to him who hateth us and whom we hate.
### h
Ye divine waters, this is thy foetus, glad and well tended have we made it for you; proclaim us as doers of good deeds among the gods.
### i
The noose of Varuna is tied, the noose of Varuna is loosed.
### k
Thou art fuel; may we prosper; thou art kindling; thou art brilliance, grant me brilliance.
### l
I have penetrated to the waters;  
We are united with the sap;  
I have come rich in milk, O Agni;  
Do thou unite me with radiance.

### a
I who deeming thee immortal,  
Mortal myself, call on thee with prayerful heart.  
Upon us, O wise one, bestow glory;  
O Agni, through offspring may I attain immortality.
### b
He, for whom, O Agni, thou dost make, O wise one,  
For his good deeds a kindly world,  
Shall win prosperity and wealth,  
Rich in sons, in heroes, in kine.
### c
To thee, O son of strength, they turn  
Who have desires to be fulfilled;  
None excelleth thee, O Indra.
### d
At each hymn the Soma delighteth Indra,  
The pressed (juices), the bountiful one [1],  
What time in unison with equal effort  
They call him to aid, like sons a father.
### e
O Agni, O wise one, with sap,  
With brilliance thou shinest,  
Slayer of Raksases, suppressor of demons.
### f
I have penetrated to the waters  
We are united with the sap;  
I have come rich in milk, O Agni;  
Do thou unite me with radiance.
### g
Rich art thou, lord of riches,  
O Agni, rich in radiance;  
May we enjoy thy loving kindness.
### h
Thou, O Agni, riches-lord of riches,  
I hail [2], O lord in the sacrifices;  
Through thee in strife may we be victorious;  
May we overcome the hostilities of mortal men.
### i
Thee, O Agni, best gainer of booty,  
The sages nourish, well lauded;  
Do thou give us wealth of heroes.
### k
May Agni here make room for us;  
May he go before us cleaving the foe  
Joyfully may he conquer our foes;  
May he win booty in the contest for booty.
### l
By Agni is Agni kindled,  
The wise, the young, the lord of the house,  
The bearer of the oblation, with ladle in his mouth.
### m
Thou, O Agni, by Agni,  
The sage by the sage, the good by the good,  
The comrade by the comrade, art kindled.
### n
O Agni, thy pure.
### o
With radiance.
