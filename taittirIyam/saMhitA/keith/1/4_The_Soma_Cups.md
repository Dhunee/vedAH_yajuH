His rays bear up the god  
Who knoweth all,  
The sun for all to see.
### b
The radiant countenance of the gods hath risen,  
The eye of Mitra, Varuna, Agni;  
He hath filled the sky and earth and atmosphere;  
The sun is the self of all that moveth and standeth.
### c
O Agni, lead us by a fair path to wealth,  
O god, knowing all the ways;  
Drive from us the sin that maketh us wander;  
We will accord to thee most abundant honour.
### d
Go to the sky, fly to heaven.
### c
With my form [1] I approach your form; with my age your age.
### f
May Tutha, all knowing, allot to you in the highest firmament.
### g
This gift of thine, Agni, cometh, impelled by the Soma.
### h
Lead it by the path of Mitra.
### i
Go ye on by the path of holy order, of brilliant gifts,  
Leading prosperity by the path of the sacrifice.
### k
May I win a Brahman to-day, a seer and sprung from seers, of (famous) father and grandfather, fit for the sacrificial gift.
### l
Gaze on the heaven, gaze on the atmosphere.
### m
Join those in the seat.
### n
Given by us, go to the gods, full of sweetness; enter the giver; without leaving us fare by the path leading to the gods; sit in the world of the righteous.
### o
Be this complete for us.
## 44
### a
May Dhatr the giver, may Savitr, rejoice in this,  
Prajapati, the lord of treasures, and Agni, for our sake;  
May Tvastr, Visnu, accord generously  
Wealth with offspring to the sacrificer.
### b
O Indra, unite us in heart, with cattle,  
O bountiful one, with generous ones, with prosperity;  
With the holy power that is made by the gods,  
With loving kindness of the gods to whom sacrifice is made.

### c
With glory, with milk, with ourselves,  
Are we united, with auspicious hearts;  
May Tvastr make fortune for us [1];  
May he set right whatever is amiss in our bodies.
### d
In that to-day, O Agni, we choose thee  
As Hotr as our sacrifice proceeded,  
Prosperously hast thou sacrificed,  
Prosperously hast thou laboured;  
Come wise and foreseeing one to the sacrifice.
### e
With Hail! to you, O gods, have we made this seat,  
Ye who have come hither rejoicing in this as the pressing;  
When ye have eaten and drunken,  
Ye all, give to us, wealthy ones, wealth.
### f
The gods whom eager thou didst bring hither, O god,  
Them [2], O Agni, do thou incite in their own abode;  
Bearing and bringing oblations,  
The rich draught, do ye mount the sky.
### g
O sacrifice, go to the sacrifice; go to the lord of the sacrifice; go to thine own birthplace; hail!
### h
This is thy sacrifice, O lord of the sacrifice, with its utterance of hymns and producing noble heroes; hail!
### i
Ye gods that find the way, finding the way, go on the way.
### k
O lord of mind, place this sacrifice, O god, for us among the gods, hail! or speech, hail! or the wind, hail!
## 45
### a
King Varuna hath made a broad path  
For the sun to travel;  
He hath made him set his feet in the pathless way;  
He driveth away whatever woundeth the heart.
### b
A hundred remedies are thine, O king, a thousand;  
Broad and deep be thy loving kindness.  
Overcome the enmity, the hostility;  
Remove from us whatever sin hath been committed.
### c
The noose of Varuna is overcome.
### d
The face of Agni hath entered the waters,  
The child of the waters guarding against the demons' power,  
In each home [1] do thou offer the kindling-stick, O Agni;  
Let thy tongue seek the ghee.
### e
In the sea is thy heart, within the waters;  
Let the plants and the waters enter thee;  
With the offerings of the sacrifice, O lord of the sacrifice,  
Let us worship at the utterance of the hymn, at the utterance of homage.
### f
O bath, O flood, thou glidest, O flood; thou hast removed by sacrifice the sin committed by the gods, through the gods, the sin committed by mortals, through mortals; guard us, O god, from wide hostility.
### g
Be the water and plants friendly to us [2]; be they hostile to him who hateth us and whom we hate.
### h
Ye divine waters, this is thy foetus, glad and well tended have we made it for you; proclaim us as doers of good deeds among the gods.
### i
The noose of Varuna is tied, the noose of Varuna is loosed.
### k
Thou art fuel; may we prosper; thou art kindling; thou art brilliance, grant me brilliance.
### l
I have penetrated to the waters;  
We are united with the sap;  
I have come rich in milk, O Agni;  
Do thou unite me with radiance.

## 46
### a
I who deeming thee immortal,  
Mortal myself, call on thee with prayerful heart.  
Upon us, O wise one, bestow glory;  
O Agni, through offspring may I attain immortality.
### b
He, for whom, O Agni, thou dost make, O wise one,  
For his good deeds a kindly world,  
Shall win prosperity and wealth,  
Rich in sons, in heroes, in kine.
### c
To thee, O son of strength, they turn  
Who have desires to be fulfilled;  
None excelleth thee, O Indra.
### d
At each hymn the Soma delighteth Indra,  
The pressed (juices), the bountiful one [1],  
What time in unison with equal effort  
They call him to aid, like sons a father.
### e
O Agni, O wise one, with sap,  
With brilliance thou shinest,  
Slayer of Raksases, suppressor of demons.
### f
I have penetrated to the waters  
We are united with the sap;  
I have come rich in milk, O Agni;  
Do thou unite me with radiance.
### g
Rich art thou, lord of riches,  
O Agni, rich in radiance;  
May we enjoy thy loving kindness.
### h
Thou, O Agni, riches-lord of riches,  
I hail [2], O lord in the sacrifices;  
Through thee in strife may we be victorious;  
May we overcome the hostilities of mortal men.
### i
Thee, O Agni, best gainer of booty,  
The sages nourish, well lauded;  
Do thou give us wealth of heroes.
### k
May Agni here make room for us;  
May he go before us cleaving the foe  
Joyfully may he conquer our foes;  
May he win booty in the contest for booty.
### l
By Agni is Agni kindled,  
The wise, the young, the lord of the house,  
The bearer of the oblation, with ladle in his mouth.
### m
Thou, O Agni, by Agni,  
The sage by the sage, the good by the good,  
The comrade by the comrade, art kindled.
### n
O Agni, thy pure.
### o
With radiance.
