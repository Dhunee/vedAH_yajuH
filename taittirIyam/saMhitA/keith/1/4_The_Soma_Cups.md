Rich art thou, lord of riches,  
O Agni, rich in radiance;  
May we enjoy thy loving kindness.
### h
Thou, O Agni, riches-lord of riches,  
I hail [2], O lord in the sacrifices;  
Through thee in strife may we be victorious;  
May we overcome the hostilities of mortal men.
### i
Thee, O Agni, best gainer of booty,  
The sages nourish, well lauded;  
Do thou give us wealth of heroes.
### k
May Agni here make room for us;  
May he go before us cleaving the foe  
Joyfully may he conquer our foes;  
May he win booty in the contest for booty.
### l
By Agni is Agni kindled,  
The wise, the young, the lord of the house,  
The bearer of the oblation, with ladle in his mouth.
### m
Thou, O Agni, by Agni,  
The sage by the sage, the good by the good,  
The comrade by the comrade, art kindled.
### n
O Agni, thy pure.
### o
With radiance.
