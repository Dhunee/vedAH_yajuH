O Agni, thou purifiest life [7];  
Do thou give food and strength to us;  
Far away drive ill-fortune.
### y
O Agni, good worker, purify for us  
Glory in good heroes;  
Giving increase and wealth to me.
### z
O Agni the purifying, with thy light,  
0 god, with thy pleasant tongue,  
Bring hither the gods and sacrifice.  

aa Do thou, O shining and purifying one,  
O Agni, bring hither the gods  

To our sacrifice and our oblation.  
bb Agni, of purest vows,  
Pure sage, pure poet,  
Shineth in purity, when offering is made.  
cc O Agni, thy pure,  
Bright, flaming (rays) arise,  
Thy lights, thy flames.
