### r
What time his glory urged the lord to strength,  
Then (did) Dyaus (let) the pure seed be sprinkled openly;  
Agni begot the host, the blameless, the youthful,  
The worshipping, and gave it impulse.
### s
He (flourishes) with keener mind, aided by thee.  
O giver! give (us wealth) in good offspring;  
O Agni, may we enjoy wealth richest in heroes;  
(Wealth) that is excellent, uttering praises to thee.,'
### t
O Agni, bring us strong wealth,  
By the force of thy glory,  
That is above [6] all men  
And openly prevaileth in contests for booty.
### u
O Agni, mighty one, bring to us  
That wealth which prevaileth in contests;
  
For thou art true, wondrous,  
The giver of booty of kine.
### v
To Agni let us make service with hymns,  
Who feedeth on bull and cow,  
The disposer, backed with Soma.
### w
For thou art, O son, a singer, seated at the feast;  
Agni made at birth a path and food;  
Do thou, O giver of strength, bestow strength upon us;  
Be victorious like a king; thou rulest within without a foe.
### x
O Agni, thou purifiest life [7];  
Do thou give food and strength to us;  
Far away drive ill-fortune.
### y
O Agni, good worker, purify for us  
Glory in good heroes;  
Giving increase and wealth to me.
### z
O Agni the purifying, with thy light,  
0 god, with thy pleasant tongue,  
Bring hither the gods and sacrifice.  
aa Do thou, O shining and purifying one,  
O Agni, bring hither the gods  
To our sacrifice and our oblation.  
bb Agni, of purest vows,  
Pure sage, pure poet,  
Shineth in purity, when offering is made.  
cc O Agni, thy pure,  
Bright, flaming (rays) arise,  
Thy lights, thy flames.
