To thee, best of Angirases,  
All folk with fair dwellings severally,  
O Agni, have turned to gain their wish.
### h
May we win by thy help, O Agni, our wish,  
Wealth with fair offspring, O wealthy one:  
May we win booty, seeking for booty;  
May we win, O deathless, undying glory.
### i
O Agni, of the Bharatas, youngest,  
Bear to us excellent, glorious wealth, [3]  
O bright one, wealth which many desire.
### k
White robed is he, thundering, standing in the firmament.  
Youngest, with loud-sounding immortal ones,  
Who, purifying, most manifold,  
Agni, marcheth devouring many broad (forests).
### l
May he give thee life on every side,  
Agni here, the desirable.  
Let thy breath come back to thee;  
I drive away the disease from thee.
### m
Giving life, O Agni, rejoicing in the oblation  
Be thou faced with ghee, and with birthplace of ghee  
Having drunk the ghee, the sweet, the delightful product of the cow,  
As a father his son [4], do thou protect him.
### n
To thee, the eager one,  
O knower of all, O active one,  
Agni, I offer this fair praise.
### o
From the sky was Agni first born,  
From us secondly he who knoweth all,  
In the waters thirdly the manly;  
The pious man singeth of him, the undying, as he kindleth him.
### p
Pure, O purifying one, to be lauded,  
O Agni, mightily thou shinest,  
To whom offering is made with ghee.
### q
Shining like gold, he hath become widely resplendent,  
For glory shining with immortal life;  
Agni became immortal in his strength [5],  
What time prolific Dyaus begat him.
### r
What time his glory urged the lord to strength,  
Then (did) Dyaus (let) the pure seed be sprinkled openly;  
Agni begot the host, the blameless, the youthful,  
The worshipping, and gave it impulse.
### s
He (flourishes) with keener mind, aided by thee.  
O giver! give (us wealth) in good offspring;  
O Agni, may we enjoy wealth richest in heroes;  
(Wealth) that is excellent, uttering praises to thee.,'
### t
O Agni, bring us strong wealth,  
By the force of thy glory,  
That is above [6] all men  
And openly prevaileth in contests for booty.
### u
O Agni, mighty one, bring to us  
That wealth which prevaileth in contests;
  
For thou art true, wondrous,  
The giver of booty of kine.
### v
To Agni let us make service with hymns,  
Who feedeth on bull and cow,  
The disposer, backed with Soma.
### w
For thou art, O son, a singer, seated at the feast;  
Agni made at birth a path and food;  
Do thou, O giver of strength, bestow strength upon us;  
Be victorious like a king; thou rulest within without a foe.
### x
O Agni, thou purifiest life [7];  
Do thou give food and strength to us;  
Far away drive ill-fortune.
### y
O Agni, good worker, purify for us  
Glory in good heroes;  
Giving increase and wealth to me.
### z
O Agni the purifying, with thy light,  
0 god, with thy pleasant tongue,  
Bring hither the gods and sacrifice.  
aa Do thou, O shining and purifying one,  
O Agni, bring hither the gods  
To our sacrifice and our oblation.  
bb Agni, of purest vows,  
Pure sage, pure poet,  
Shineth in purity, when offering is made.  
cc O Agni, thy pure,  
Bright, flaming (rays) arise,  
Thy lights, thy flames.
