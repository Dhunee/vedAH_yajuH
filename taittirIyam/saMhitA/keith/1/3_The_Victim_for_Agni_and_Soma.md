### a
These waters are rich in oblation,  
Rich in oblation is the divine sacrifice,  
Rich in oblation he seeks to win (the gods?),  
Rich in oblation be the sun.
### b
In the seat of Agni whose home is abiding I set you down, kindly for kindness, accord to me kindness.
### c
Ye are the share of Indra and Agni; ye are the share of Mitra and Varuna; ye are the share of the all-gods.
### d
Be watchful over the sacrifice.

To the heart thee! To mind thee! To the sky thee! To the sun thee!
### b
Raise aloft the sacrifice; in the sky guide to the gods the prayers.
### c
O King Soma, come hither, descend.
### d
Fear not, tremble not.
### e
Lot me not harm thee.
### f
Do thou descend to creatures; let creatures descend to thee.
### g
Let Agni (kindled) with the kindling-stick hear my appeal, Let the waters hear, and the divine Dhisanas;  
Hearken, ye pressing stones, to the sacrifice of me the wise one, Let the god Savitr hearken to my appeal.
### h
Ye divine waters, child of the waters, that wave,  
Which is rich in oblation, powerful and sweetest,  
Give to the gods among the gods,  
Pure to the drinkers of the pure, (to them) whose share ye are; hail
### i
Thou art the dragger; do thou (drag) away the foe of the waters.
### k
I draw you for the sustenance of the waters.
### l
That mortal, O Agni, whom thou hast helped in the battles, Whom thou hast strengthened in the contest for booty, He winneth I abiding strength.

### a
Thou, O Agni, art Rudra, the Asura of the mighty sky, Thou art the host of the Maruts, thou art lord of food; Thou farest with ruddy winds, blessing the household; Thou, as Pasan dost, protectest thy worshippers with thyself.
### b
Rudra, king of the sacrifice,  
True offerer, priest of both worlds,  
Agni before the dreadful thunder,'  
Of golden colour, win ye for help.
### c
Agni hath set him down as priest, good sacrificer, On the lap of his mother, in the fragrant place,  
The youthful, the wise, pre-eminent among men [1], righteous, Supporter of the folk in whose midst he is kindled.
### d
Good hath he made our sacrifice this day;  
The hidden tongue of the sacrifice have we found  
He hath come, fragrant, clothed in life;  
He hath made our sacrifice this day to prosper.
### e
Agni hath cried like Dyaus thundering,  
Licking the earth, devouring the plants;  
Straightway on birth he shone aflame;

### f
He blazeth with his light within the firmaments.  
In thee, O many-faced sacrificer [2],  
Morning and evening, the sacrificers place their treasures,  
In whom, purifying, good things are placed, even as the heaven and earth (support) all beings. 
### g
To thee, best of Angirases,  
All folk with fair dwellings severally,  
O Agni, have turned to gain their wish.
### h
May we win by thy help, O Agni, our wish,  
Wealth with fair offspring, O wealthy one:  
May we win booty, seeking for booty;  
May we win, O deathless, undying glory.
### i
O Agni, of the Bharatas, youngest,  
Bear to us excellent, glorious wealth, [3]  
O bright one, wealth which many desire.
### k
White robed is he, thundering, standing in the firmament.  
Youngest, with loud-sounding immortal ones,  
Who, purifying, most manifold,  
Agni, marcheth devouring many broad (forests).
### l
May he give thee life on every side,  
Agni here, the desirable.  
Let thy breath come back to thee;  
I drive away the disease from thee.
### m
Giving life, O Agni, rejoicing in the oblation  
Be thou faced with ghee, and with birthplace of ghee  
Having drunk the ghee, the sweet, the delightful product of the cow,  
As a father his son [4], do thou protect him.
### n
To thee, the eager one,  
O knower of all, O active one,  
Agni, I offer this fair praise.
### o
From the sky was Agni first born,  
From us secondly he who knoweth all,  
In the waters thirdly the manly;  
The pious man singeth of him, the undying, as he kindleth him.
### p
Pure, O purifying one, to be lauded,  
O Agni, mightily thou shinest,  
To whom offering is made with ghee.
### q
Shining like gold, he hath become widely resplendent,  
For glory shining with immortal life;  
Agni became immortal in his strength [5],  
What time prolific Dyaus begat him.
### r
What time his glory urged the lord to strength,  
Then (did) Dyaus (let) the pure seed be sprinkled openly;  
Agni begot the host, the blameless, the youthful,  
The worshipping, and gave it impulse.
### s
He (flourishes) with keener mind, aided by thee.  
O giver! give (us wealth) in good offspring;  
O Agni, may we enjoy wealth richest in heroes;  
(Wealth) that is excellent, uttering praises to thee.,'
### t
O Agni, bring us strong wealth,  
By the force of thy glory,  
That is above [6] all men  
And openly prevaileth in contests for booty.
### u
O Agni, mighty one, bring to us  
That wealth which prevaileth in contests;
  
For thou art true, wondrous,  
The giver of booty of kine.
### v
To Agni let us make service with hymns,  
Who feedeth on bull and cow,  
The disposer, backed with Soma.
### w
For thou art, O son, a singer, seated at the feast;  
Agni made at birth a path and food;  
Do thou, O giver of strength, bestow strength upon us;  
Be victorious like a king; thou rulest within without a foe.
### x
O Agni, thou purifiest life [7];  
Do thou give food and strength to us;  
Far away drive ill-fortune.
### y
O Agni, good worker, purify for us  
Glory in good heroes;  
Giving increase and wealth to me.
### z
O Agni the purifying, with thy light,  
0 god, with thy pleasant tongue,  
Bring hither the gods and sacrifice.  
aa Do thou, O shining and purifying one,  
O Agni, bring hither the gods  
To our sacrifice and our oblation.  
bb Agni, of purest vows,  
Pure sage, pure poet,  
Shineth in purity, when offering is made.  
cc O Agni, thy pure,  
Bright, flaming (rays) arise,  
Thy lights, thy flames.
