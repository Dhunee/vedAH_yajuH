## 01
### a
Homage to thy wrath, O Rudra,  
To thine arrow homage also;  
Homage to thy bow,  
And homage to thine arms.
### b
With thy most kindly arrow,  
And kindly bow,  
With thy kindly missile,  
Be gentle to us, O Rudra.
### c
That body of thine, O Rudra, which is kindly, Not dread, with auspicious look,  
With that body, most potent to heal,  
O haunter of the mountains, do thou look on us.
### d
The arrow which, O haunter of mountains,  
In thy hand [1] thou bearest to shoot,  
That make thou kindly, O guardian of mountains; Harm not the world of men.
### e
With kindly utterance thee  
We address, O liver on the mountains,  
That all our folk  
Be free from sickness and of good cheer.
### f
The advocate hath spoken in advocacy,  
The first divine leech,  
Confounding all the serpents  
And all sorceries.
### g
The dusky, the ruddy,  
The brown, the auspicious,  
And the Rudras which in thousands  
Lie around this (earth) in the quarters [2],  
Their wrath do we deprecate.
### h
He who creepeth away,  
Blue-necked and ruddy,  
Him the cowherds have seen,  
Have seen the bearers of water  
And him all creatures;  
May be, seen, be gentle unto us.
### i
Homage to the blue-necked,  
Thousand-eyed one, the bountiful  
And to those that are his warriors  
I have paid my homage.
### k
Unfasten from the two notches  
Of thy bow the bowstring,  
And cast thou down  
The arrows in thy hand [3].  
1 Unstringing thy bow,  
Do thou of a thousand eyes and a hundred quivers, Destroying the points of thine arrows,  
Be gentle and kindly to us.
### m
Unstrung is the bow of him of the braided hair And arrowless his quiver;  
His arrows have departed,  
Empty is his quiver.

### n
O most bountiful one, the missile  
That is in thy hand, thy bow,  
With it on all sides do thou guard us,  
Free from sickness.
### o
Homage to thy weapon,  
Unstrung, dread;  
And homage to thy two hands,  
To thy bow.
### p
May the missile from thy bow  
Avoid us on every side,  
And do thou lay far from us  
This quiver that is thine.

O chaser, lord of the Soma plants,

(Any) of these people, of these cattle;  
Be not one of these injured.

That auspicious form of thine, O Rudra,  
Auspicious and ever healing,  
Auspicious and healing (form of) Rudra,  
With that show mercy on us for life.

This prayer we offer up to the impetuous Rudra, With plaited hair, destroyer of men,  
That health be for our bipeds and quadrupeds,  
And that all in this village be prosperous [1] and free from ill.

Be merciful to us, O Rudra, and give us delight; With honour let us worship thee, destroyer of men; The health and wealth which father Manu won by sacrifice, May we attain that, O Rudra, under thy leadership.
### e
Neither our great, nor our small,  
Our waxing or what has waxed,  
Do thou slay, nor father nor mother;  
Injure not, O Rudra, our dear bodies [2].

Clad in thy skin, come,  
And approach us bearing the spear [4].  
1 O blood-red scatterer,  
Homage to thee, O adorable one;  
May thy thousand missiles  
Smite down another than us.

Are the missiles in thine arms;
  
O adorable one, do thou turn away  
The points of those which thou dost rule.
