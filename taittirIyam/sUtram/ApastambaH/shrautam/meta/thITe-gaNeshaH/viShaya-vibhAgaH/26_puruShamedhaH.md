## 20.25


सौत्रामण्या मैत्रावरुण्या चामिक्षया साकंप्रस्थायीयेन पञ्चबिलेन चरुणा पञ्चशारदीयेनेति॥१॥
1. Sautrāmaṇī offering and[^1] an offering of milk-mess (Āmikṣā) for Mitra and Varuṇa, the Sākaṁprasthāyīya[^2] offering, a five-holed[^3] rice-pap and the Pañcaśāradīya[^4] offering.[^5]  

[^1]: The text reads 'ca'. Caland suggests va and compares XVIII.7.15. This suggestion appears to be plausible.  

[^2]: See III.16. 11-17.3.  

[^3]: For the details see the next Sūtra.  

[^4]: For this see XXII.20.9-21.11.  

[^5]: For this Sūtra cp. ŚB XIII.6.2.20. While translating these two 
Sūtras Caland says that one should enter into the village after having performed Traidhātavīya-offering, This does not appear to be correct. The text reads grāmaṁ vā praviśya i.e. after having 
entered in the village.  

पञ्चयिलस्य चरोर्विज्ञायते। आज्य आग्नेयः पूर्वस्मिन्बिले। दधन्यैन्द्रो दक्षिणे। शृते प्रतिदुहि नीतमिश्रे वा वैश्वदेवः पश्चिमे। अप्सु मैत्रावरुण उत्तरे। पयसि ang paraat 11211 
2. It is knuwn about the five-holed rice-pap as follows :(in a pot having five cavities) rice-pap in ghee for Agni in the eastern cavity, (rice-pap) in curds, for Indra in the southern (cavity), (rice-pap) in cooked milk or in cooked milk mixed with fresh butter for the Viśvedevas in the western (cavity), (rice-pap) in water for Mitra-Varuṇa in the northern (cavity), (rice-pap) in milk for Br̥haspati in the central (cavity) (should be cooked and then offered).[^1]   

[^1]: This five-holed rice-pap might have been taken from ŚB V.5.1.1.
