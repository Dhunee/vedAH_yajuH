1. The second main offering in the Full-moon-sacrifice. 

ऐन्द्राग्नविकाराः वा।।४४॥
44. Or as the modifications of the offering to Indra-and 
Agni.' 
1. The second main offering in the New-Moon-sacrifice. 

अन्यत्र प्रकृतिदेवताभ्यो यथैन्द्रः पुरोडाशः सौम्यश्चरुरिति॥४५॥
45. Except the deities of the basic paradigm; as for example sacrificial bread for Indra and rice-pap for Soma. 


हविर्देवतासामान्ये हविर्बलीयः॥४६॥
46. In the conflict between the oblation-material and deity, oblation-material is stronger. 


द्रनासंस्कारविरोधे द्रव्यं बलीयः।।४७॥
47. In the conflict between the oblation-material and the sanctificiation of the oblation-material the oblation-material is stronger. 


अर्थद्रव्यविरोधे ऽर्थो बलीयान्॥४८॥
48. In the conflict between the purpose and the offering material, the purpose is stronger. 


न प्रकृतावूहो विद्यते।।४९। 
49. There is no change in the formula in the basic paradigm. 
विकृतौ यथार्थमूहो ऽर्थवादवर्जम्॥५०॥
50. In the modificatory rite the change in the formula should be done in accordance with the requirement with the exception of the Arthavada (Explanation)s. 
1427 


परवाक्यश्रवणादर्थवादः५१॥
51. Atharvāda is there where the expression of another is heard. 


शिष्टाभावे सामान्यात्प्रतिनिधिः।।५२॥
52. In the absence of any direct mention, the substitute (should be decided) on the basis of similarity.

## 24.04


स्वामिनो ऽग्नेर्देवतायाः शब्दात्कर्मणः प्रतिषेधाच्च प्रतिनिधिनिवृत्तः॥१॥
1. The substitute is stopped (i.e. not allowed) for the owner (i,e. the sacrificer), the fire, the word (i.e. the formula), the action, and for the prohibited.1 
1. Thus for example when it is said that the beans should not be offered, this prohibition remains always valid. 

त्रिभिः कारणैः प्रकृतिर्निवर्तते प्रत्याम्नानात्प्रतिषेधादर्थलोपाच्च॥२॥
2. The basic paradigm stops (i.e. not followed) on account of three reasons: when there is a counter-sacred-text,' when it is prohibited, or when the purpose will not be served.3 
-1. Seeeg.xXII.4.19ff. 2. Seeeg.VII.14.21. 3. While cooking rice-pap one should not use flour because the 
grains are expected to remain distinct even when they are cooked 
and this purpose will not be served when flour is used. 

अग्निष्टोम एकाहानां प्रकृतिः॥३॥
3. Agnistoma is the basic paradigm of the one day sacri 
fices. 
1428 
Translation : THITE 
[XXIV.4 


द्वादशाहो ऽहर्गणानाम्॥४॥
4. Dvādaśāha (is the basic paradigm) of the groups of days i.e. of the Ahīna and Sattra sacrifices. 


गवामयनं सांवत्सरिकाणाम्॥५॥
5. Gavāmayana (Course of Cows) (is the basic paradigm) of the year-long-sacrificial-sessions. 


निकायिनां तु प्रथमः॥६॥
6. For sacrifices which form groups the first (one is the paradigm for the remaining ones)." 
1. Cp. XXII.1.2. Thus the sacrifices like the four Sāhasras XXII.2.4. 
the four Sãdyaskras (XXII.2.6.ff), the four Dvirātras XXII.14.16ff 
are the sacrifices forming groups. 

अग्निष्टोम उत्तरवेदिः॥७॥
7. In the Agnistoma-sacrifice (there is) an Uttaravedi. 

उत्तरेषु क्रतुष्वग्निः ॥८॥
8. In the next (sacrifices there is) the fire-altar-building (made with bricks). 


अन्यत्र साद्यस्केभ्यो वाजपेयात्षोडशिनः सारस्वताच्चसत्त्रात्॥९॥
9. Except in the (following sacrifices): Sãdyaskras', Vajapeya', Sodasin', and Sarasvata-sacrificial-session'. 
1. XXII.2.6ff. 2. XVIII.1.1ff. 3. XIV.2.2ff. 
4. XXIII.12.4ff. 

क्रत्वादौ क्रतुकामं कामयेत॥१०॥ यज्ञाङ्गादौ यज्ञाङ्गकामम्॥११॥
10-11. The sacrificer should desire (express his desire) in the beginning of a sacrifice; (and) the desire of a subsidiary rite of a sacrifice in the beginning of that subsidiary rite of the sacrifice. 
1429 

अल्पीयांसो मन्त्रा भूयांसि कर्माणि तत्र समशः प्रतिविभज्य पूर्वैः पूर्वाणि areg To FireTfOTI18 P11 
12. When there are less formulae and more acts one should divide the formulae equally and use the first formula for the first act, the next formula for the next act." 
1. Thus TS II.2.1 sacrificial breads are mentioned and TS 1.1.14. 
a-d there are four formulae. Then for the sake of first three sacrificial breads TS 1.1.14 a and b and for the last three TS 1.1.14.c-d are 
to be used. अल्पीयांसि कर्माणि भूयांसो मन्त्रास्तत्र प्रतिमन्त्रं कुर्यात्। अवशिष्टा विकल्पार्था यथा यूपद्रव्याणीति॥१३॥
13. When there are less acts and more formulae, then one should use the formulae in their order each one for each act; the remaining formulae are optional as for example the substances of the sacrificial post. 


अन्ताल्लोपो विवृद्धिा॥१४॥
14. At the end there should be exclusion' or addition.2 
1. In the case of sacrificial bread prepared on five potsherds for 
Agni (e.g. XIII.25.5) while placing the potsherds there are eight formulae available in the basic paradigm (1.22.3-23.1). Here the 
last three are to be excluded. 2. In the case of the sacrificial bread prepared on nine potsherds for 
Vişnu (see e.g. X.30.12). The last formula out of the eight in the 
basic paradigm is to be used twice. 

प्रकृतेः पूर्वोक्तत्वादपूर्वमन्ते स्यात्॥१५॥
15. Because the basic paradigm is mentioned first, the new (different detail) should be at the end.! 
1. Thus e.g. in connection with the Nakşetraṣṭi BaudhāśS XVIII.3. 
4 the Upahomas (additional libations) are to be made at the end of the offering i.e. before the Samiṣṭayajus. (ApSS III. 13.2) According to BaudhāśS XXVIII.3 they should be performed before the 
Sviştakst. Cp. ApśS II.21.2. 

कुम्भी शूलवपाश्रपणीप्रभुत्वात्तन्त्रं स्यात्॥१६॥ जातिभेदे तु भिद्येत पक्तिवैषम्यात्॥१७॥
16-17. The cooking pot, (heart-roasting) spit, and the Vapāśrapaņi (y-shaped sticks) for roasting the Omentum' 
1430 
should be common (to all the victims) because they are capable for being used for more than one victim.2 But when there is a difference (of the genus of the victims) then these things should be different, because of the difference in cooking. 
1. See VII.8.3. 2. When the animals are of the same genus like he-goat as in the case 
of seventeen he-goats for Prajāpati (XVII.2.3). 
3. As e.g. in the case of Paívekādasinī. 

स्विष्टकृद्विकारे वनस्पतौ याज्यायां देवतानिगमाः स्युः प्रकृत्युपबन्धात्॥१८॥
18. In the offering to Vanaspati' which is a modification of Sviṣtakst the addresses to the deity should be in the offering verse because they are connected with the (basic paradigm)”. 
1. See VII.25.15. 2. See VII.25.16. 3. i.e. this also happens in the basic pardigmatic rites viz. New and 
Full-moon-sacrifice. 

अन्वारम्भणीया विकृतौ न स्यात्प्रकृतिकालमध्यत्वात्। कृता हि तदर्थेन॥१९॥
19. The Anvārambhaṇīyā (offering)' should not be per formed in a modificatory-rite because it is in the middle of the time of the basic paradigm (that the modificatory rites occur);2 (and the Anvārambhaṇīyā offering) is indeed (done for it basic paradigm). 
1. See V.23.4-24.6. This is to be done before the New and Full 
moon-offerings and the Cāturmāsya-sacrifices. 2. i.e. the New and Full-moon-offerings and the Cāturmāsyas are 
performed throughout the life. 3. The Anvārambhaṇīyā-offering) is performed in the beginning of 
the New and Full-Moon-offerings and the Cāturmāsya sacrifices. 

स्याद्वा कालस्याशेषभूतत्वात्॥२०॥
20. Or (the Anvārambhaniyā-offering) may be (performed in the modificatory rites) because the time (of the New and Full-moon-sacrifices) does not form an integral part (of the ritual). 


आरम्भविभागाच्च॥२१॥
21. And because the beginning (of it) is separated (from the beginning of the paradigmatic rites viz. New and full-moon sacrifices as far as the time of it is concerned). 
_1431 


अर्थायार्थायाग्निं प्रणयति। अपवृत्ते कर्मणि लौकिकः संपद्यते यथा समारूढे॥२२॥
22. For every purpose (i.e. for every performance of a rite) (the Adhvaryu) carries fire forwards.' When the rite is over, the fire becomes profane as in the case (of fire which has been) taken up.? 
1. i.e. from the Garhapatya to the Ahavaniya. See I.1.2. 
2. See VI.28.8-11.
