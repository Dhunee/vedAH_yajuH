## 23.01
चतुर्विंशतिपरमाः सत्त्रमासीरन्॥१॥
1. At the most twenty-four (persones) may perform a sacrificial session.  


तेषां द्वादशाहेन सत्तभूतेन कल्पो व्याख्यातो यानि पुरस्तात्संवत्सरात्। गवामयनेनेतरेषाम्॥२॥
2. The procedure of those sessions which (come to an end) before a year, has been explained by (the explanation of the Dvādaśāha of Sattra-type[^1]; of others by the Gavāmayana.[^2]   

[^1]: See XXI.1.1-14.15.  

[^2]: See XXI.15.1-23.14.  

उभयतोऽतिरात्राणि भवन्ति॥३॥
3. (The sacrificial sessions) are (those) on the both-sided, i.e. in the beginning and end of which (there is an) Atirātra.[^1]  

[^1]: This is in contrast to an Ahīna in which an Atirātra is only on one side i.e. at the end. See XXII.14.1. See also TS VII.2.6.3; VII.3.4.2.  

तृतीयं पञ्चदशरात्रं परिहाप्य कुण्डपायिनां च सत्त्रम्॥४॥
4. Having excluded the third Pañcadaśarātra (fifteen-day sacrificial-session)[^1] and the session of Kundapāyins.[^2]  

[^1]: See XXIII.2.7-8.  

[^2]: XXIII. 10.6-12. Both these sessions have an Atiratra only at the end. This Sūtra gives an exception to the rule mentioned in the 3rd Sūtra.  

ऋतूनामेकादशरात्रेण प्रजां सृजन्ते प्रजामवरुन्धते प्रजां विन्दन्ते प्रजावन्तो भवन्ति।५॥
5. By means of the Eleven-day-sacrifificial-session[^1] of the R̥tus (seasons), the performers produce progeny, get progeny, obtain progeny, become possessors of progeny.[^2]  

[^1]: According to what has been said in XXII. 14.1 this sacrifice should be considered as an Ahīna. But this sacrifice seems to be an exception. The support for this sacrifice being considered as an exception is provided by TS VII.2.6.2. where the expression “āsate (sit)" is used which is generally used in connection with sacrificial session. Moreover this sacrifice has an Atirātra on both the sides. This peculiarity makes it a Sattra.  

[^2]: For this sacrificial-session see in general TS VII.2.6.1-3.  

ज्योतिरतिरात्रः पृष्ठ्यः षडहस्त्रय श्छन्दोमा अतिरात्रः॥६॥
