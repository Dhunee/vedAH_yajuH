1236 
fice for any one else, in order to avoid evil”-So is known for a Brahmana-text). 
1 See TS VII.2.10.4. From this it is implied that one should not 
work as a priest for Dvādaśaha-sacrifice which is performed as an ahina. On the other hand one may participate in Dvadasiha pro vided it is Sattra in which case one will have to be one of the 
sacrificers only.

a Kṣatriya or a Vaiśya can be the thirteenth sacrificer.

possible". According to me there is no need to change the reading. The word avibhavinaḥ means “impossible". So those details which cannot be done collectively should be done individually in the 
case of each performer.
