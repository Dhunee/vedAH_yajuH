ONE-DAY-SOMA-SACRIFICES: EKĀHA-S 
## 22.01
एकाहेष्वहीनेष्विति प्राकृतीदक्षिणा ददाति। यथासमाम्नातं वा॥१॥
1. In the one-day-sacrifices and Ahīnas (having two to twelve-soma-sacrificial days) (the sacrificer) should give the same gifts (as are to be given) in the basic paradigmatic Soma sacrifice or as has been mentioned in the sacred texts.[^1]   

[^1]: e.g. XXII.4.24.  


सर्वक्रतूमा प्रकृतिरग्निष्टोमः। निकायिनां तु प्रथमः सर्वत्र। यथादिष्टं  
2. The basic paradigm for all the sacrifices is Agniṣṭoma; that for the (sacrifices which) form group (and are mentioned under one name)[^1] the first (one is the basic paradigm); or as has been mentioned.  

[^1]: c.g. the four Sāhasras (XXII.2.4), the four Sādyaskras,(XXI.2.16), or four Dvirātras (XXII 14.16).   


ज्योतिर्गौरायुरिति त्रिकद्रुकाः॥३॥
3. The Jyotis, Go, and Āyus are the Trikadruka-s.[^1]  

[^1]: i.e. The first three days called Trikadruka-s of the Abhiplava 
ṣaḍaha (cf. TMB XVI.3.8) can be performed separately as individual sacrifices.  
 


प्रथमो ऽग्निष्टोम उक्थ्या वा सर्वे।४॥
4. The first (out of these three) (should be performed as) Agniṣṭoma.[^1] Or all of them (should be performed as) Ukthyas.  

[^1]: According to TMB XVI.3.8 the first should be Agniṣṭoma, and 
the next two should be Ukthyas.  

ज्योतिषि सहस्रं ददातीति श्यैतनियमाबृहत्पृष्ठः॥५॥ 
गौतृव्यवतः। आयुः स्वर्गकामस्य। अग्निष्टोमस्तु भ्रातृव्यवतः। विश्वजि दग्निष्टोमः श्रेष्ठ्यकामस्य॥६॥
5-6. In the Jyotis (-sacrifice) one gives thousand (cows). On account of the rule about Syaita, which has the Br̥hat sāman as the first Pr̥ṣṭha-stotra,[^1] the Goṣṭoma sacrifice is of a (sacrificer) who has enemies,[^2] the Āyus (sacrifice) (is) of a (sacrifier) desirous of heaven;[^3] the Agniṣṭoma however (is) of a (sacrificer) who has enemies; Visvajit Agniştoma (sacrifice) of a (sacrificer) desirous of superiority.[^4]  

[^1]: From Ārśeya-Kalpa III.1.b we know that in the Goṣṭoma sacrifice 
the third Prşğha-stotra is suing on Syaita-sāman. Thereby it is sug gested according to the rule that the first Pr̥ṣṭha-stotra should be 
sung on the Br̥hat-sāman.   

[^2]: Cf. TMB XVI.2.4.  

[^3]: Cf. TMB XVI.3.3.

[^1]: Cp. XX.9.14-10.1; cf. ŚB XIII.7.1.13. 

उत्तमां दक्षिणां नीत्वोदवसाय वा दक्षिणेनौदुम्बरी प्रानिषद्य ब्रूयाद्यन्मे ऽद ऋणं यददस्तत्सर्वं ददामीति॥१०॥
10. After he has led the last gift (cow) or after he has got up[^1] (from the sacrifice) having sat to the south of the Audumbarī post with his face to the east he should say “Whatever debt I have to N.N. I give all that.”  

[^1]: See XIII.25.3ff. 

उदवसाय रोहिणी वत्सच्छवीमिति समानम्॥११॥ 
11. After having got up (i.e. after the Udavasānīya Iṣṭi is performed) (the sacrificer having worn) the red hide of a calf etc. (should do) the same.[^1]

[^1]: Cp. JB II.169, KB XXVII,  

बृहत्तु होतुः पशवश्चैकादशैकयूपे॥१४॥

met arat: 71141:118 11 
1. There are three Vācaḥ Stomas (Stomas of Speech).  

पूर्वावग्निष्टोमौ रथंतरसामानौ। सर्वस्तोमो ऽतिरात्र उत्तरः॥२॥
2. The First two are Agniṣṭomas with the Rathantara as the first Pr̥ṣṭhastotra, the third is an Atirātra with all the Stomas.  


तस्मिन्सर्वा ऋचः सर्वाणि सामानि सर्वाणि यजूंषि प्रयुज्यन्ते॥३॥
3. In it all the R̥cs, all the Sāmans, and all the Yajus are used.

4. In (Order to lead the ) life of the Vratyas, Vrātyastomas are to be performed; they are to be performed as Ukthyas with (the Rathantara as the first Pr̥ṣṭhastotra. The second Vrātyastoma can be optionally performed as an Agniṣṭoma (also).[^1]  

[^1]: Thus the Vrātyastomas are to be performed by those Āhitāgni 
sacrificers who intend to become Vrātyas. Vrātyastomas are Soma sacrifices and can be performed only by Āhitāgnis and not by Vrātyas. This is quite in contranst with Kātyāyanaśrautasūtra XXII.4.27-28 according to which Vrātyas have to perform the Vrātyastomas and after these sacrifices are performed, they should stop leading the life of Vrātyas and then they became socially acceptable. It seems that Āpastamba represents the original tradition because only an Āhitāgni can perform any Soma-sacrifice. A Vrātya who is an out-caste even according to Kātyāyana is really speaking unable to perform any Śrauta ritual. So there is a contradition in Kātyāyana's view. There is none in that of Āpastamba. The modern scholars have not paid attention to this Sūtra of Āpastamba.  



उष्णीषं प्रतोदो ज्याह्रोडो रथो विपथः फलकास्तीर्णो ऽश्वो ऽश्वतरश्च युग्यौ कष्णशं वासः कृष्णबलक्षे अजिने रजतो निष्कः॥५॥
