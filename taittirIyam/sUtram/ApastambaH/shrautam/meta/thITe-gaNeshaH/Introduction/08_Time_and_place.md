(8) There is a general agreement among the scholars in connection with the place and time the Āpastambaírautasūtra. It has been accepted by scholars that Āpastamba belonged to the Āndhra-region in the South India. He might have lived not later than the fifth century B.C. His work is one of the comparatively younger works but not one of the youngest works (cf. Garbe vol. III. p. XV-XVI).
