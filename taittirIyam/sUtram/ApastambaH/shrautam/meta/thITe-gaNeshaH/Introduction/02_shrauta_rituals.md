(2) The Śrauta-rituals are mainly of two types: i) Havir yajñas (Iṣṭis) and ii) Somayajñas. The New and Full-moon sacrifies (Darsapūrṇamāsau) form the basic paradigm of the Havir-yajñas. Agnistoma forms the basic paradigm of the Soma Sacrifices. The Somayajñas are divided into three categories which are based upon the duration of the performance as well as peculiarities of the performance as such: i) Ekāha one-day sacrifices; ii) Ahīna: sacrifices being performed for two to twelve days iii) Sattra: Sacrifices being performed for twelve days or more number of days. The longest sacrifices mentioned by the ritual texts are to be performed for one thousand years.
