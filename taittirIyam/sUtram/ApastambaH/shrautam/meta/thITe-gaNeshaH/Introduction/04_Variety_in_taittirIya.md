+++
(4) The three Śrautasutras of the Taittirīya-Branch of the Black Yajurveda viz. Bhāradvāja, Āpastamba and Satyāṣāḍha Hiraṇyakeśin form one group. Bhāradvāja is sometimes more concise but by and large these three Śrautasūtras very much similar to each other as far as the ritualistic details, style and vocabulary are considered. In comparision to Baudhāyana, they are less diffuse and more concise. They also contain many references to the other schools. Therefore they are more rich than Baudhāyana as far as the contents are considered.
