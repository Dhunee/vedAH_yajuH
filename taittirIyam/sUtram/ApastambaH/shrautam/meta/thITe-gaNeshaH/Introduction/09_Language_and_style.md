(9) The language and style of the Āpastambaśrautasūtra has a lot of similarity with those of the classical Sanskrit. But still there are some peculiarities and archaisms in the text. Būhler has rightly observed that the ritualists in general were deficient in their education (ZDMG, XL, p. 705). This is correct in later times as well as modern times also.+++(5)+++

In Āpastamba-srautasūtra the optative third person singular takes yita rather than yeta 16.g. prakṣālayita, abhiprāśayita etc.).

The tmesis which is a peculiarity of ancient vedic language is found in ĀpŚS also abhi va mantrayeta: IX 6.11; abhi ca ghārayet XIII. 2.9 etc. In the word durvarāhaidakaḥ (IX. 10.5) there is a double Sandhi.

Some other irregularities and Prākr̥tisms are as follows: r̥tve (instead of r̥tviye); aṇikāṣam (II. 11.3), instead of anikāṣam, vyrṣaṇ (II. 14.4, instead of vyrṣan) etc. The words like ghoṭa (horse) (XV. 3.12), tambala in tambalavīṇā (XXI. 17.16; 19.3) are borrowings from local languages (for these and similar more examples see Garbe, Apss, UI. p. Vff.)
