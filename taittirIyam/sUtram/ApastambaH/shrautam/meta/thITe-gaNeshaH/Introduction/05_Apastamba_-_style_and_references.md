title = "05 Āpastamba - style and references"

+++
(5) Āpastamba probably belonged to a period later than that of Bhāradvāja. They are very similar to each other in style, structure and order of subjects (except a few details). Sometimes even the wording in both the texts is identical. Āpastamba's rules are at times ampler and somewhat curious.

Āpastamba, like Baudhāyana places Mantras before injunctions. In this respect, he differs from Bhāradvāja.+++(4)+++ Apastamba quotes more authorities than Bhāradvāja.

Āpastamba quotes the views of Āśmarathya and Ālekhana. There are many references to the views of eke (some). Here actually the views of Bhāradvāja are indirectly mentioned.+++(4)+++

Āpastamba contains more references to the Brāhmaṇa-texts than Bhāradvāja. The Vājasaneyakam (Brāhmaṇam) is mentioned more than fifty times. But only a few of these references are found in the Satapatha-Brāhmaṇa in the same form.+++(4)+++ Many of these references do not occur in the ŚB at all; some are even contradicted by the SB and Kātyāss.+++(4)+++

The references to the R̥gveda (Bahvịca) Brāhmaṇa are similar to those of the Kauṣītaki-Brāhmana, but Āpastamba's text of the RV-Brāhmaṇa is not identical with the Kauṣītaki-Brāhmaṇa.

Āpastambaśrautasūtra contains modified mantras and mantras from other Saṁhitās even when Taittiriyas have their own mantras for a particular ritual. Sometimes Āpastamba follows other texts (e.g. V. 3.16 follows MS I. 6.8) contradicting his own Brāhmana (viz. Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa I. 1.2.8) (For paragraphs 4 and 5 cf. J. Gonda, A History of Indian Literature, The Ritual Sūtras, Wiesbaden, 1977).+++(4)+++
