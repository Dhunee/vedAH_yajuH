My foremost thanks are due to W. Caland whose German translation of Āpastamba Śrautasūtra has been extensively used by me. The English section of the Śrautakosa by R.N. Dandekar has also been fruitfully consulted by me. I express my deep sense of gratitude towards W. Caland and R.N. Dandekar. I acknowledge with thanks the help rendered by Dr. Maitreyee Deshpande in writing of this work. Finally I also thank Shri Subhash Jain, New Bhartiya Book Corporation, Delhi for all his enthusiasm in printing and publishing this work.
