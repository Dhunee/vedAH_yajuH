title = "PREFACE"

+++
WHEN, ten years ago, I published my edition of the Apastambīya Grhyasūtra, and at the same time made a first copy of the Mantrapāṭha, I thought I should be able to publish an edition of the latter within one or two years. It is due to unfortunate circumstances that the work has been delayed so long. 

I hope I shall soon be able to publish the Second Part, which will contain an English translation and the Commentary of Haradatta. 

My thanks are due to the Delegates of the Clarendon Press for allowing this work to appear in the Anecdota' Series, and to Professor Max Mūller for recommending it to them. I have also to thank the Librarians of the Bodleian Library, of the Vienna University Library, of the India Office Library, of the Royal Asiatic Society, and of the Elphinstone College, Bombay, for kindly placing their MSS. at my disposal. I have again, as on former occasions, to express my sincerest thanks to Hofrath Dr. G. Būhler for the kind interest he has taken in my work, by procuring MSS. for me, and by assisting me most disinterestedly with his advice, whenever it was wanted. To Dr. Eugen Hultzsch I am indebted for the loan of the MS. from Tiruvidaimarudur, and for making enquiries regarding MSS. of Sāyaṇa and Sudarśanārya. 

Finally I have to acknowledge my obligations to Mr. J. C. Pembrey, the excellent Oriental Reader of the Clarendon Press, for all the care he has bestowed on the printing of this text.
