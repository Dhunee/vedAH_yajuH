Ishana Bali is another grihya yajna which has been mandated by various sutrakaaraas. It is also known as shUlagava, Chaitri etc. Other sutrakaras mandate gavalambhana, as primary karma. This being kalivarjya, this yajna is not done except by Apastambins. Apastamba has not mandated gavalambhana but just a sthalipaka on aupasana Agni, another on laukikagni for kshetrapati.

This yajna is in honour of Ishana, Meedushi (Parvati) and Jayanta ( Skanda) and is a nitya karma ( mandatory karma). Some vyakhya say this has to be done once in a life time, others say every year. The benefits are aishwaryam, go samvriddhi etc.

One unique aspect of this yajna is that it cannot be done in one's griha like other pAkayajnas, but in a public place like outside temple, hill top, river bank, matha etc. Also this yajna is one of the only 3 occasions where Apastamba explicitly approves taking out live aupasana Agni without samaropa. Other two being bringing Agni to the pati's griha after vivaha ( after which pravishya homa is done), and the other instance being antyeshti, where the live aupasana Agni is taken for cremation.

The yajna involves homa for Ishana, meedushi and jayanta in aupasana Agni, as well as building kuti ( place of worship) for Ishana and Meedushi. After the homa, all the 3 are offered shodasopachara and  balis in front of the kuti - 30 balis for Ishana, 6 for Meedushi and 6 for Jayanta. Thereafter one pindam is prepared on a donnai, put into a pot and hung on a nearby tree.

Then on the way back home, 7 balis to be offered to kshetrapati. One interesting aspect about kshetrapati is that we first offer Bali and then do puja. Apastamba says - क्षिप्रं यजेत पाको देवः anakula vyakhya describes - पाको बालस्तद्वत् गमनशीलो अयं देवः - Like a child he cannot be engaged in one thing for long, and will leave quickly. So feed him first then do other stuff like puja etc.

The live aupasana Agni is brought back home and installed in its place and Punyahavacanam and Naandi shrAddham is done.

Then brahmana bhojanam where the home sesha also has to be served. The karta and family consume the rice from which the kshetrapati Bali is offered. Another interesting aspect of this yajna, is that SriRudra Japa has to be done without svaras (chAtussvarya).
