The sautramaNI sUkta-s of the different yajurveda-s are interesting in that they homologize the ritual (beer-fermentation included) with the putting together of a new body for indra who was poisoned. That act is like a dissection in reverse & primarily conducted by the surgeons of
the deva-s, the ashvin-s and sarasvatI. It is notable that in one of these sUkta-s the ashvin-s are termed rudravartanI:

तद् अश्विना भिषजा रुद्रवर्तनी  
सरस्वती वयति पेशो अन्तरम् ।
अस्थि मज्जानं मासरैः करोतरेण दधतो गवां त्वचि ॥

This occurrence of rudravartanI is independent of all its occurrences in the RV. sarasvatI puts together (literally weaves) the muscles within and the ashvin-s, the physicians, following on Rudra's track, place the marrow [in] the bones [as the]  the wort [from] the fermented grain with a sieve on the ox hide. The use of this phrase in this context suggests that ashvin-s inherited their medical skills from their father rudra. Likewise their knowledge of toxins also inheres from rudra.+++(5)+++
