### FOREWORD
In the last century, and at the beginning of the present, George Thibaut and A. Bürk brought to the notice of the scholarly world the mathematical significance of two sūtra texts, namely the Sulba-sūtras by Baudhāyana and Apastamba. These two works are manuals for the construction of various types of altars for fire-sacrifice, an ancient cult fully established in the time of the Samhitās. Their mathematical importance lies in a precise statement of the squared relationship of the two sides and the diagonal of a rectangle, the realization of the irrationality of numbers like √/2, efforts to determine their approximate values, formulation of rules for combining rectilinear figures, transforming squares into rectangles, triangles, trapeziums and circles and vice versa, the use of simple fractions and approximate values of π. All these arose from the mensuration of laying altars of a fixed square area but of different shapes and filling them with a fixed number of bricks necessarily of different geometrical shapes. The Greek tradition of the development of geometry from the more ancient Egyptian mensuration, the rope- stretcher's art, appears to have its counterpart in the scriptural tradition of the Sulba-sūtras. That similar tradition obtained in other culture areas has become increasingly clear with advancing knowledge of the cuneiform texts and ancient Chinese mathematical sources.

I am happy that the authors of the present monograph have presented the full critical texts and translations of the four sulba-sūtras by Baudhāyana, Apastamba, Katyayana and Manava and modern commentaries on them. A carefully prepared introduction has dealt with: the genesis of these texts as part of the ritual literature (Kalpasūtras) constituting one of the six Vedāngas; the vexed question of the antiquity of these sūtras; the philosophical significance of performing fire sacrifices on various types of altars; and other related questions. Regarding the dating of Baudhayana, Mānava, Āpastamba and others a balanced view has been maintained between the opinions of European sanskritists like Bühler, Keith, Macdonell, Renou and Filliozat and those of Indian scholars like Kane and Ramgopal. Though the date of Baudhāyana, the earliest of sūtra writers, still varies over a range of two to three centuries, there is no doubt that the tradition of altar construction and the related sacrifices goes back to the period of the Samhitās and the Brāhmaṇas antidating the sutras, as the numerous passages in the Taittiriya, Maitrāyaṇī, and Kapiṣṭhala Samhitās and the Satapatha and other Brāhmaṇas amply indicate.

From its very inception the National Commission for the Compilation of History of Sciences in India has laid emphasis on the study of primary source materials. In astronomy and mathematics such materials are abundant. In 1966, the same two scholars along with a third carried out a bibliographical study of Sanskrit works on astronomy and mathematics. This has been followed by critical editions, translations and commentaries of the works of Aryabhața and Lalla by a number of scholars working for the National Commission. Now we have the śulba texts in the same series. We look forward to several such studies of our rich primary sources with a view to evolving a better understanding of the development of the various sciences in ancient and medieval India.

### PREFACE
The present monograph on the śulbasūtras by Baudhāyana, Apastamba, Katyayana and Mānava was planned by the History of Science Unit established at Calcutta by the History of Science Board of the Indian National Science Academy (then called the National Institute of Sciences of India) and continued by the National Commission for the Compilation of History of Sciences in India. The Unit under the supervision of one of us (S.N.S.), with which the other author (A.K.B.) was then associated as a Research Scholar, functioned at first at the Asiatic Society and subsequently at the Calcutta office of the Academy in the same premises of the Society. This happy location permitted the free and frequent use of the Society's rich library and its manuscript holdings. The authors also had the opportunity of consulting the MS No. Th. 184 of the Mānava-śulba kept at the National Library, Calcutta and a microfilm transcription of the MS. No. 536 of the same text available at the Bombay Branch of the Asiatic Society. We express our sincere thanks to the Librarians of the Asiatic Society and the National Library, Calcutta and the Bombay Branch of the Asiatic Society for permitting us to make use of the aforesaid manus- cripts in their respective holdings. We also place on record that late Nagendranath Vedantatirtha, Curator of the Asiatic Society rendered us his ungrudging help in elucidating some of the difficult passages of the sūtras, particularly of the Mānava- śulba. We further express our grateful thanks to the Academy for providing a Senior Research Fellowship to one of us (A.K.B.) and contingent grants to meet the expen- ses of the project.

### INTRODUCTION
The Vedāngas, that important group of literature often referred to as the appendages of the Vedas, constitute an important source in the history of science in ancient India. This is evident from such subjects as phonetics (śikṣā), ritual (kalpa), grammar (vyākaraṇa), etymology (nirukta), metrics (chanda) and astronomy (jyotiṣa). These branches of study arose within the Vedic schools themselves as a necessary condition for mastering the Vedas. This class of literature was written in the sūtra or aphoristic style, a form of expression characterized by great precision, brevity and economy of words, the like of which is not met with in the entire literature of the world. The style has been developed to sum up only the pith of the learning in short sentences using nouns often compounded at great length and avoiding the use of verbs as far as possible. The style became a dominant feature of the various branches of the Vedāngas and was also adopted by the writers of the Arthaśāstra, the Kāmaśāstra, the Nāṭyaśāstra and so on.

The Kalpasūtras, concerned principally with the rituals constituting the chief contents of the Brāhmaṇas, are supposed to be the first Vedānga to have received systematic treatment.a The Kalpasūtras are again available in four different classes, e.g. the srauta, the grhya, the dharma and the sulba. The Srautasūtras deal with śrauta- sacrifices abundantly discussed in the Brāhmaṇas and are naturally concerned with direction for the laying of the sacrificial fires for the fire-sacrifice (agnihotra), the new and the full-moon, the seasonal, the soma and other sacrifices. These are, as Winternitz has pointed out, our most important source for the understanding of the Indian sacrifice-cult. Through their preoccupation with the laying and construction of the various sacrifical altars and fires, these also constitute an important source of Vedic, and possibly the earliest, mathematics in India. Of special importance as far as concerns mathematics, geometry in particular, are the Sulbasūtras which are sometimes classified as a separate branch of the Śrautasūtras, but which are often found attached to the Śrautasūtras.

The Sulbasūtras are of special importance because these deal specifically with rules for the measurements and constructions of the various sacrificial fires and altars and consequently involve geometrical propositions and problems relating to rectilinear figures, their combinations and transformations, squaring the circle and circling the square as well as arithmetical and algebraic solutions of problems arising out of such measurements and constructions. The word sulba (also spelt as śulva) means a 'cord', a 'rope' or a 'string', and its root sulb signifies 'measuring' or 'act of measurement'. It is interesting to note that, among the Egyptians, geometry of surveying was considered to be the science of the 'rope-stretchers' (harpedonap'tae) who thus appear to be the Egyptian counterpart of the Indian sulbavids.

Quite appropriately, therefore, the Šulbasūtras represent the Brahmaṇa geometry or mensuration, the śulba-vijñāna, as mentioned in the Manava and other sulbas and in their commentaries. It is also evident that the sulbavid, the expert geometer was held in high esteem in the learned priestly circles.+++(5)+++

Since Sulbasutras form part of the Srautasūtras, inspite of their separate classification under the Kalpasūtras, one would expect a sulba section attached to each Srautasutra. And there are Śrautasūtras belonging to all the four Samhitās. But what we possess today are a small number of Śulbasūtras attached to the frautas belonging only to the various schools of the Yajurveda. 

Of them the Black Yajurvedins of the Taittiriya school were the most active and prolific producers of the sūtra text, and it is no wonder that the most comprehensive, as also the largest number of, Šulbasūtras were produced by the scholars of this school, such as Baudhāyana, Āpastamba, Vādhula and Hiranyakeśin. 

Of the Maitrāyaṇi school, Mānava and Vārāha are known to have written works on the sulba. 

In this subject Kāṭhaka-Kapiṣṭhala school is represented by Laugākṣi. 

Of the White Yajurvedins, Kātyāyana, another prolific writer of the sutras is credited with a small but scientifically executed śulba work. 

Maśaka, the sūtrakāra of the Samaveda school probably also compiled a sulba text attached to the Śrautasūtras of that school. 


The initiative of the Yajurvedins in producing works of this kind is not surprising when we bear in mind that they were the principal custodians of the knowledge of sacrificial formulas and specialized in sacrificial performances.

Of these various ŝulba works, those due to Baudhāyana, Āpastamba, Kātyāyana and Manava are best known, and others are known through references. We tried to locate manuscripts of some of these latter ones, but without success and had to be content with the Sulbasūtras by the four aforesaid scholars. The need for a monograph dealing with the different Šulbasūtras, in one volume so as to present a comprehensive view of the subject, inspite of the excellent studies of some of these texts by distinguished scholars, has long been felt, and has been further reinforced by the fact that the works of Thibaut and Bürk published towards the end of the 19th and the beginning of the present century are now very difficult to obtain. That the works of Thibaut and Bürk constituted the main inspiration of our humble efforts presented in these pages need hardly be overestimated.

#### PLACE AND TIME OF THE AUTHORS OF THE ŚULBASŪTRAS

There is a good deal of uncertainty and differences of opinion about the place and time of the śulbakāras. The Śrautasūtras and the Šulbasūtras are silent about these questions as are other Vedic and post-Vedic texts. Georg Bühler who considered the question of date and time of Baudhayana and Āpastamba was inclined to believe that both of them hailed from the Andhra country. He argued that the followers of Baudhāyana and Āpastamba had lived in south India since early times, that Baudhāyana manuscripts had been found in the south, and that the Mahārṇava, an early work mentioned Andhra country as the native place of Apastamba. 

- a Bühler, SBE, 14, pp. xliii; 2, pp. xxx.

[[3]]

Bühler also pointed out that the name of Āpastamba had been found on several land-grants of the south and that both Baudhāyana and Āpastamba referred in their Dharma-sūtras to the manners and customs of the people of their times inhabiting the northern parts of India, a reference rather unusual for authors hailing from the north. Recently Ramgopal has shown that, in their Śrautasūtras and Dharmasūtras, Baudhāyana gave ample evidence of his close familiarity with Aryavarta, the doab between the Ganges and the Yamuna and its surroundings and Āpastamba with Kurupāñcăla country and its vicinity.[a] About the places of origin of Kātyāyana, Mānava and other sulbakāras, nothing definite can be said.

If their native places are open to question so are their dates. Bühler placed Apastamba around the fifth century B.C. but did not himself consider this date as conclusive or anything more than tentative. He was only definite that both Baudhāyana and Āpastamba had lived before the third century B.C. Between these two sūtrakāras, all scholars agree, Baudhāyana is anterior to Āpastamba.

Instead of working downwards from the high antiquity of Baudhāyana and Apastamba whatever that antiquity might be, other scholars have preferred to consider the dates of later writers like Pāņini, Kātyāyana, and Patañjali and work upwards to arrive at the dates of Baudhayana and Apastamba. Here again, Panini's date itself is debatable and no better datable than other ancient texts. Nevertheless, scholars are generally agreed that Pāṇini most probably lived in the fourth century B.C. Keith argued that Pāņini's date depended essentially on the date to be assigned to the Mahābhāṣya of Patañjali. Renou and Filliozat and Keith placed Patanjali's date around c.150 B.C. on the ground that the Mahābhāṣya referred to a sacrifice by Puşyamitra who reigned around c. 185 or 178 B.c. In his Veda of the Black Yajurveda, Keith has observed that by 140 B.C. Pāņini's work attained a commanding position as is evident by the clear proof of the elaborate way in which it was commented upon in Dākṣāyaṇa's Samgraha, by Kātyāyana and others and concluded that Pāņini's date could hardly by any chance be later than 300 B.C., nor there could be any reason to deny that he might have lived about 350 B.C.
This brings us to the date of Katyāyana who flourished after Pāṇini and before Patanjali. Admitting that there is no direct proof, Keith suggested 250 B.C. as the most probable date for Kātyāyana. Eggeling, on the other hand, placed Kātyāyana in the fourth century B.C. after considering a still earlier date for Panini. Macdonell, in his Bṛhaddevatād favoured a date c. 350 B.c. for Kātyāyana, more or less in agree- ment with Eggeling.
Bühler, Keith and other scholars all agreed that the irregular forms persistently used by Baudhayana and Āpastamba in composing the whole texts of the Srauta-, the Grhya- and the Dharma-sutras could have hardly been possible after Pāņini's grammar reached its accepted position. Bühler, therefore, considered Apastamba

SULBASUTRAS
anterior to Pāṇini by about 150-200 years, which would place the former in the fifth- sixth century B.C. In his Ãpastamba Śrautasūtra, Garbe, in general agreement with Bühler, assigned Āpastamba to the fifth century B.C. Keith considered such a high date for Apastamba improbable from consideration of language and would not take him beyond say 300 or 350 B.C. By Keith's own agreement with Bühler that Apastamba could be anterior to Panini and his statement that there is absolutely no conclusive evidence of the date of these early sūtrakāras, it is somewhat baffling to understand how Apastamba could be placed around c. 350 B.C.
Regarding Baudhāyana and Mānava, both have been considered definitely older than Apastamba, as their archaic style of writing would indicate. Manava whose works were used by Āpastamba wrote more or less in the Brāhmaṇa style, and Richard Garbe considered his sūtra as the oldest, but that, as Keith points out, was before the text of Baudhayana was known. Baudhāyana's archaic Brāhmaṇa style, is clearly discernible in his uttarati as also in all his sūtra writings. Considering all this, Keith's conservative estimate for Baudhāyana's date was fifth century B.C. while Caland was prepared to place him in the sixth century B.C. in his Über das Rituelle Sūtra des Baudhāyana.a Mānava doubtless should be placed somewhere between Baudhāyana and Āpastamba. P. V. Kane in his History of Dharmasutras dated the Srautasūtras of Baudhāyana, Āpastamba and Katyāyana between 800 B.C. and 400 B.C. Ramgopal who considered the sequence between Baudhāyana and Apastamba, Apastamba and Pāṇini, Pāņini and Katyāyana and Kātyāyana and Patañjali, more or less agreed with Kane and concluded that the principal sūtras were composed between c. 800 B.C. and 500 B.C.
The foregoing discussion will make it abundantly clear that we are still far from narrowing the date range differing by centuries and putting the early sutra works on a firmer chronological basis. What is generally accepted is this relative chronological position in order of anteriority, e.g. Baudhāyana, Mânava, Āpastamba, Pāṇini, Kātyāyana. Hiraṇyakeśī, Vārāha, Vadhula and so on. This is also somewhat borne out by the tradition of the Taittiriya school which would place the early sūtrakāras in the following order of age: Baudhāyana, Bharadvāja, Āpastamba, Satyāṣāḍhā, Hiranyakeśin and Vaikhānasa. Whatever date one might wish to assign to the Kalpasutras, the Śrautasūtras and the Śulbasutras, we must agree with Thibaut that these sūtras only give a systematized account of sacrificial rites which had been practised during long preceding ages. The rules for the sides of the various altars, detailed arrangement of the sacrificial ground, the positioning of the fires, altars, tents and sheds, the shapes of the fire-altars in the form of the falcon and other birds are all mentioned and discussed in various ways and at various places in the Brāhmaṇas as we shall see in what follows. The manner in which the measure- ments and transformations had to be carried out, in other words, the geometry and mensuration involved in their construction, it is true, are not discussed in the Brāhmaṇas and cannot be expected either in this class of literature. But there can hardly be any doubt that what Baudhāyana, Āpastamba, Mānava, Katyāyana

and others tried to codify in a systematic manner in their Śulbasūtra manuals must have for a long time formed the common property of all adhvaryus and priests specialized in the performance of sacrificial rites.
REFERENCES TO SACRIFICIAL ALTARS AND FIRES IN SAMHITĀS AND BRAHMANAS
The Vedic cult knew no temple. The ceremonies were performed either in the sacrificer's house or on a nearby plot of ground. This ground must be flat and covered with grass. For the performance of sacrifices, certain vedis and agnis had to be constructed. A vedi is a specified raised area on which the sacrifice is to be per- formed and on which persons performing the ceremony, namely the sacrificer, the hotā, the adhvaryu, the ṛtvik and others are to take their seats. Some of the main vedis include the mahāvedi, the darśapūrṇamāsa vedi, the śautrāmaṇi vedi, the paitṛki vedi, the uttara vedi, and the aśvamedha vedi. An agni is a raised altar, generally made of bricks, for keeping the fire. The fire-altars were of two types, the nitya (or perpetual) and the kamya (or optional). The three perpetual fire-altars were the garhapatya, the āhavaniya and the dakṣiṇāgni and meant for daily sacrifices. The kāmya agnis intended for wish fulfilment, included the syenacit, the vakrapakṣa-vyasta-puccha-śyena, the kańkacit, the alajacit, the praugacit, the ubhayata praugacit, the droṇacit, the rathacakracit, the śmaśānacit, the kūrmacit, and so on.
The mention of the garhapatya fire occurs at several places in the Rg-veda.a In another place, there is a a reference to three
three places (trisadhasthe) of the agni, implying the garhapatya, the āhavaniya and the dakṣiṇāgni. A reference to the form of fyena is found in the Rg-veda where agni is frequently called a bird (vayas)©. The Ag-veda also contains references to altars and their constructions of which a few examples are as follows: 'Let the priests decorate the altar (vedi), let them kindle the fire to the east' 'May the measure-lengths (yūpa) of the sacrificial posts be to our felicity; may the sacred grass (oşadhi) be (stream) for our happiness; may the altar (vedi) be (raised for) our happiness”.
In the Taittiriya Samhita,f it is so ordained that the garhapatya citi is to be constructed with 21 bricks arranged in an identical manner. Similar passages are found in the Maitrāyaṇī Samhitā, Kāṭhaka Samhitā and the Kapiṣṭhala Samhitā.o In the Taittiriya Samhitā, it is said,1 "He who constructs (the gārhapatya citi) for the first time should construct in five layers....
for the second time should construct in three layers....
He who constructs .”. The saumiki vedi

The measures are also given in other samhitās. Although elaborate descriptions of rites and ceremonies in connection with the construction of the various altars such as the dārśapaurṇamāsa vedi, the uttara vedi, the āgnidhriya the hotriya, the mārjālīya, the sadas (tent), the uparavas etc. are found in the Taittiriya and other samhitās, their measurements and constructional details are rarely given.

         The standard form of an optional fire-altar was that of a certain bird. This bird was called spena in the Taittiriya Samhitā© and suparna garutman or well winged eagle in the Vājasaneya Samhita. The spatial magnitudes of the falcon-shaped fire-altar were also given in almost all the earlier works from the Taittiriya Samhitā onwards. The measurements were made with units like aratni, vyāma, purușa etc. The area on which these fire-altars were drawn covered 71⁄2 sq. purușas. A complete list of the various kāmya agni together with a statement of the objects for the attainment of which each of them has to be constructed, as found in the Taittiriya Samhitā,1 is given below :

         INTRODUCTION
         As regards the height of the agni and the number of bricks to be used in its construction, Taittiriya Samhitaa observes:
         "He should pile (the fire) of a thousand (bricks) when first piling (it); this world is commensurate with a thousand; verily he conquers this world. He should pile (it) of two thousand, when piling a second time, the atmosphere is commensurate with two thousand; verily he conquers the atmosphere. He should pile (it) of three thousand; verily he conquers the yonder world. Knee-deep should he pile (it) when piling for the first time, verily with the gayatri he mounts this world; naval-deep should he pile (it) when piling for the second time, verily with the triṣṭubh, he mounts the atmosphere; neck-deep should he pile (it) when piling for the third time, verily with the jagati, he mounts the yonder world".
         An expert in this science was called agnicit (constructor of the agni). The term appears in the Taittiriya Samhitab and the Maitrāyaṇi Samhitā.
         d
         In the Yajurveda, we find an elaborate and tedious rite of the agnicayana or the construction of the fire-altar, associated with highly speculative philosophy. The same mystic significance is found in different schools of this Samhitā, e.g. the Taittiriya, the Maitrayaniya, the Kathaka-Kapisthala and the Vajasaneya. This shows that the agnicayana rite and its philosophy had already taken definite shape in the time of the Yajurveda. The existence of different masters of this science with independent views is also referred to in the Taittiriya Samhitā.©
         The relative positions of the three nitya fires, the gārhapatya, the ābavaniya and the dakṣiṇāgni are also described in the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa. The gārhapatya fire is represented like a man lying on his back with head 'towards the east'. The first clear description of the gārhapatya as a circle of one square vyāma and of the āhavaniya as a square of the same size appears in the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa. The garhapatya fire is to be constructed with 21 bricks.h
         In the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa, the same measure of the mahāvedi as given in the Taittiriya Samhitā has been adopted. The kāmya agnis such as the suparṇa garutman, the dronacit, the rathacakracit, the kankacit, the praugacit, the ubhayata praugacit etc. have been described here. These kāmya citis all measure 71⁄2 sq. purușas. Regarding

         SULBASUTRAS
         the areas of the fire-altars, the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa observes, "According to one (school), ekavidha agni should be constructed first, then by an increment of one (square purușa) successively upto a construction of an unlimited size. But indeed the agni (or Prajapati) was to be constructed first as saptavidha (71⁄2 sq. purușas and then by the increment of one square purușa) in succession is to be made upto ekaśatavidha (101 sq. puruṣas)"a Compare this with Baudhāyana's and Āpastamba's statements in their sulbasūtrasb that one fold means 11 sq. purușas, two-fold means 21⁄2 sq. purușas, seven-fold means 71⁄2 sq. purușas and so on. This has also been explained by other Sulbakāras.
         GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF ŚULBASŪTRAS,
         THEIR GEOMETRY, ARITHMETIC AND ALGEBRA
         In our section on 'Commentaries', we have discussed in detail the sutras of the four texts by Baudhāyana, Āpastamba, Kātyāyana and Manava. In presenting the texts, their translations and commentaries, we have not followed the chronological order in which these were written as would appear from our foregoing discussions, but in order of their importance and completeness.
         Baudhāyana's sūtras are not only the earliest but represent the most systematic, logical and detailed treatment of the subject inspite of their archaic and highly condensed sūtra style. It opens with the various units of linear measurements and then develops the geometry of rectilinear figures, triangles and circles, their trans- formations from one type to the other, methods of arriving at areas by combination or difference of given areas, the irrational number like √2 and the value of " albeit indirectly. Then the measurements of the three perpetual fires, the gārhapatya, the ahavaniya and the dakṣiņāgni, the sacrificial altars such as the mahāvedi, the uttara vedi the sautrāmaṇi vedi, the paitṛki vedi, the dārśapaurṇamāsika vedi, the paśubandha vedi, various sacrificial fires such as the dhiṣṇyas, the agnidhriya, and the mārjaliya, the sadas tent, the havirdhāna shed for the placement of the soma carts and various pits like the utkara, the uparava and the catvāla are given along with their relative distances from one another. Although the plan of the sacrificial ground and placement therein of the various fires, altars, tents, sheds and pits is not described in separate sūtras, the manner in which their measurements, relative distances and directions for their placements are given makes it quite easy for one to visualize the picture of the sacrificial ground and at once appreciate how closely and meticulously the śulbavid was following the time-honoured Vedic sacrificial practices. About the fire-altars for the various wish fulfilments (kāmyaciti), Baudhāyana gives the measurements, con- structions and methods of laying bricks of different geometrical shapes in alternate layers following the strict injunction that the edges of bricks in contiguous layers must not meet. Such fire-altars include those in the form of a falcon, both rectilinear and with curved wings and extended tail, of a kite and alaja bird, of an

         isosceles triangle and a rhombus, of a chariot-wheel without and with spokes, of a square and circular trough, of a pyre, and finally one in the form of a tortoise. The facile use of geometry presented in the opening chapters is abundantly clear in the constructional procedures of these fire-altars.
         Apastamba follows more or less the same procedure and provides the same rules and techniques; but in our view, coming after Baudhāyana and with his text before him, he has not shown any improvement upon Baudhāyana. About the fire-altars, he has discussed different types of syenacit, rectilinear as well as those with curved wings and extended tail and given different arrangements with different types of bricks, but has not gone into the details of other types which he mentions presumably because he has no alternative method of arrangement to suggest. As far as the use of terms and expressions are concerned, there is a remarkable resemblance between Baudhāyana and Āpastamba.
         Katyāyana's treatment is succinct and systematic. He emphasizes the geometry behind the construction of altars and fires and gives a clear exposition of it. He deals with a few altars and agnis but refrains from considering the kāmyacitis as the latter are discussed separately in a chapter of his Śrautasutras.
         The Manava-sulbasutra, a part of the Śrautasutra by the same author, although following the common tradition of the sulbakāras, gives methods and details often very difficult to comprehend. In many cases the details are either lacking or incomplete and can be understood only by reference to Baudhayana, Āpastamba and Katyāyana. To us the very arrangement and the treatment of the subject have appeared far from systematic. In our judgement, the work does not measure up to the standard attained by Baudhāyana, Āpastamba and Kātyāyana.
         Geometry
         Several methods of constructing a square on a given straight line have been given. Rectangles are rectilinear figures of which the two sides are different. For the construction of such rectilinear figures the squared relationship between the diagonal and the two sides has been given at various places in the fulbasūtras, which we summarize below:

         Theorem of Square on the Diagonal of a Square or a Rectangle
         The above-mentioned squared relationships are followed or preceded by the general statement that the diagonal of a rectangle produces by itself both (the areas) produced separately by its two sides. This is the so-called theorem known after Pythagoras. A question has often been asked whether such a definition resulted from empirical guess work or was based on a proof of some kind. Such questions are of course to be expected from scholars firmly entrenched in the Euclidean tradition in geometry. As is well known, mathematics, including geometry, in ancient India did not follow the Euclidean tradition, and usually gave the rules, leaving their proofs to be explained by the teachers to the pupils of their respective schools. Several scholars who discussed this issue of proof have shown that such proof is implicit in the very operations with rectilinear figures; we have discussed the matter in detail in our commentaries in connection with the rule and further elaboration here is unnecessary. George Sarton, while considering the question of Hindu influence on Pythagorean derivation of the theorem of squares, referred to Gaston Milhaud's claim that Pythagorean geometry may have been partly inspired by Hindu models. This argument was based on the high antiquity of Baudhayana and Āpastamba. But Sarton, presumably on the basis of Keith's views on the dates of the sulbakāras, pleaded inability to accept such high antiquity and observed: 'It is highly probable that the fulbasūtras date from a period posterior to 500 B.c. and pre-Christian. They are probably post-Pythagorean".a
         This brings us to the important question of the origin of the theorems and also whether Pythagoras himself was the discoverer of it.
         The tradition attributing the theorem to Pythagoras is due to Cicero (c. 50 B.C.) Diogenes Laertius (second century A.D.), Athenaeus (c. A.D. 300), Heron (third

         century A.D.), and Proclus (c.A.D. 460), and therefore started about five centuries after the death of Pythagoras. Junge pointed out that the Greek literature of the first five centuries after Pythagoras contained no mention of the discovery of this or any other important geometrical theorem by the great philosopher and furthermore emphasized uncertainties in the statements of Plutarch and Proclus. Although various attempts have been made to justify the tradition and trace the proof to Pythagoras, no record of proof has come down to us earlier than that given by Euclid (Theorem 47, BK 1). As to the relation 42+32-52 from which the theorem of rational triangle is derivable, very ancient Egyptian knowledge is attested by the Kahun papyrus of the twelfth dynasty (c. 2000 B.C.), but its association with rational triangles does not seem indicated in this or other Egyptian papyrii.a As to the antiquity of Pythagorean theorem in China, it is stated, though not proved, in the arithmetical classic Chou Pei Suan Ching (third or fourth century B.C.); the numerical relationship 4, 3 and 5 between the sides and the diagonal of a rational rectangle is also given in this text. The old Babylonians of the second millennium B.C. left records on their cuneiform tablets of similar squared relationships indicating practical use of the theorem of squares. No general statement in the form of a theorem is of course found. Neugebauer is of the view that Pythagoras derived his number theorem of the universe as well as the theorem known after his name from such Babylonian cuneiform tablets.b
         As we have stated, methods have been given for transforming rectilinear figures from squares to rectangles, of transforming squares into circles, of developing isos- celes triangle and rhombus from squares and so on. Various geometrical shapes like parallelograms, five-sided rectilinear figures are mentioned in various ways in connection with the construction of bricks with which to cover the sacrificial altars.
         Irrational numbers, π, Fractions, Surds
         What is of great significance is the treatment of irrational numbers like 2 and statement of their accurate values. The manner in which such accurate values were possibly obtained by the sulbakāras has been fully discussed in our notes. Neugebauer has shown that these values are identical with those found in certain Babylonian cuneiform texts, given in sexagesimal system. He tried to imply that the Indian value after all represented the Babylonian one expressed only in decimal system or more accurately in fraction. As we have shown, there is certainly no proof of such an assertion and the Indian value is certainly derivable from the methods contained in the sulbasutras themselves.
         In connection with the pits for stacking the sacrificial poles in, Baudhāyana has given the ratio of the circumference to the diameter as 3. We have shown from the rules for transforming squares into circles, as given by Baudhāyana, that the śulba- kāras in all probability knew of more accurate value of π.

         ŚULBASŪTRAS
         The fulbakāras were familiar with the use of fractions and manipulated with them in various ways, specially in connection with the construction of bricks for the fire-altars. The terms used by them are significant as well as interesting, of which few examples are given:
         caturbhagona =1-1=1
         ardhāṣṭama =7골 ardhadasama =91
         ardhanavama
         =81

         (Bśl. 5.1)
         (Āśl. 19.4)
         (Asl. 19.7)
         In our notes we have explained that elementary knowledge of operating with surds was also possessed by these geometers. It will certainly be not proper to say that the fulbakāras dealt with algebra as is known from later Indian mathematicians. But it cannot be denied that germs of algebraic equation are embedded in many of their rules and operations. Such is the case with quadratic equation as also with indeterminate equation of the first degree. As we have amply stressed, these texts were compiled primarily as manuals for the construction of sacrificial fires and altars. Geometry, mensuration, arithmetic, and germs of algebra came out only incidentally. Nevertheless, the gleams we obtain of their knowledge of these subjects can hardly fail to excite our admiration when we remember the time of their compilation.
         SOURCE MATERIALS AND PLAN OF WORK
         In our edition of the Baudhayana-śulba, we have used Thibaut's edition as printed in the Pandit and Caland's edition of the śulba attached to Baudhāyana's Śrautasūtra. Bürk's plan in the break-up of the sutras and their numbering has been followed. This plan appeared to us systematic and logical inasmuch as the breaking up of the sutras and their numbering were generally guided by considerations of self-contained state- ments. It may also be noted that Caland punctuated the sutras from similar considerations although no numbering was used. We have, however, retained Thibaut's numbering within parenthesis in order that scholars already accustomed to Thibaut's edition may not experience any difficulty. Our edition of the Apastamba- śulba is based on Bürk's Das Āpastamba-śulbasūtra and the Mysore edition of the same text. Bürk's arrangement and numbering have been mostly retained; only a few sūtras have been regrouped from considerations of self-consistency. In such regroupings also Bürk's number has been given within parenthesis. For the Kātyā- yana-śulba, we have used the editions by Madana Pāṭhaka, the Kāśī Sanskrit series and the MS. No. G. 6145 of the Asiatic Society, Calcutta. In our edition of the Mānava-śulba, Van Gelder's edition of the sulba attached to the Śrautasutra and the MS. No. Th. 184 of the National Library, Calcutta have been used and Gelder's arrangement and grouping retained.
         As to commentaries, Dvārakānātha's Sulbamimāṇsā on Baudhāyana, the com- mentaries of Kapardisvāmi, Karavindasvāmī and Sundararāja on Āpastamba,

         Karkabhāṣya and Mahidhara's Sulbasūtravṛtti on Kātyāyana, and MS. No. 536 of the Bombay Branch of the Asiatic Society, a commentary on the Mānava-śulba, have been used. Other manuscripts used by previous editors like Thibaut, Bürk and Van Gelder have been referred to in the foot-notes.
         We have given the texts, translations and our own commentaries in separate parts, always referring to the number used in our edition wherever necessary. In writing the commentaries again, the sūtras, singly as well as in groups, have been treated as found convenient for purposes of elucidation. In the case of the Apastamba- śulba, a number of chapters dealing with the same topic, e.g. the construction of syenacit, have been dealt with together for the same reason.

  The various constructions of sacrificial fires are now given.
  1.2
  We shall explain the methods of measuring areas of their (different) figures (drawn) on the ground.
  1.3. Now, the measure of an angula is 14 anus (grain of Panicum milliaceum); according to others, (it is) 34 tilas (sesamum indicum) placed broad side on. One small pada is 10 aǹgulas; one prādeśa 12 añgulas; one pṛthā and one uttara- yuga 13 angulas each; one (big) pada 15 añgulas. One îșă measures 188 angulas; one akṣa 104 añgulas; one juga 86 angulas; one jānu 32 añgulas; one samyā and one bāhu 36 añgulas each. One prakrama equals 2 padas (30 angulas); one aratni 2 prādeśas (24 añgulas). But there are also instances of pada, yuga, prakrama, aratni and śamyā having different measures when these (words) are used as units of measurement. 5 aratnis (120 añgulas) make one purușa; one vyāma also has the same measure (5 aratnis); and 4 aratnis (96 añgulas) make one vyāyāma.

  Having desired (to construct) a square, one is to take a cord of length equal to the (side of the) given square, make ties at both ends and mark it at its middle. The (east-west) line (equal to the cord) is drawn and a pole is fixed at its middle. The two ties (of the cord) are fixed in it (pole) and a circle is drawn with the mark (in the middle of the cord). Two poles are fixed aɩ both ends of the diameter (east-west line). With one tie fastened to the eastern (pole), a circle is drawn with the other. A similar (circle) about the western (pole). The second diameter is obtained from the points of intersection of these two (circles); two poles are fixed at two ends of the diameter (thus obtained). With two ties fastened to the eastern (pole) a circle is drawn with the mark. The same (is to be done) with respect to the southern, the western and the northern (pole). The end points of intersection of these (four circles) produce the (required) square.
  Now another (method). Ties are made at both ends of a cord twice the measure and a mark is given at the middle. This (halving of the cord) is for the east-west line (that is, the side of the required square). In the other half (cord) at a point shorter by one-fourth, a mark is given; this is the nyañcana (mark). (Then) a mark is given at the middle (of the same half cord) for purposes of (fixing) the corners (of the square). With the two ties fastened to the two ends of the east-west line (pṛṣṭhyā), the cord is to be stretched towards the south by the nyañcana (mark); the middle mark (of the half cord) deter- mines the western and the eastern corners (of the square).
  When (the construction of) a rectangle is desired, two poles are fixed on the ground at a distance equal to the desired length. (This makes the east-west

  line). Two poles one on each side of each of the (two above mentioned) poles are fixed at equal distances (along the east-west line). A cord equal in length to the breadth (of the rectangle) is taken, its two ends are tied and a mark is given at the middle. With the two ties fastened to the two end poles (on either side of the pole) in the east, the cord is stretched to the south by the mark; at the mark (where it touches the ground) a sign is given. Both the ties are now fastened to the middle (pole at the east end of the prăcî), the cord is stretched towards the south by the mark over the sign (previously obtained) and a pole is fixed at the mark. This is the south-east corner. In this way are explained the north-east and the two western corners (of the rectangle).
  When the eastern side is desired to be of shorter measure, a mark is given at half (the tiryaṁmāni).
  Now another (method). Ties are made at both ends of a cord of length equal to the measure increased by its half (so that the whole length of the cord is divided into three parts of half the measure each). In the third (extended) part on the western side a mark is given at a point shorter by one-sixth (of the third part); this is the nyañcana. Another mark is made at the desired point for fixing the corners. With the two ties fastened to the two ends of the east- west line (pṛṣṭhyā), the cord is stretched towards the south by the nyañcana, and the western and eastern corners (of the square) are fixed by the desired mark.
  The diagonal of a square produces double the area (of the square). 1.10 The breadth (of a rectangle) being the side of a given square (pramāņa) and the length the side of a square twice as large (dvikaraņi), the diagonal equals the side of a square thrice as large (tṛkaraņi).
  1.11
  1.12
  Thereby is explained the side of a square one-third the area of given square (trtiyakaraṇī). It is the side of a square one-ninth the area of the square (explained in the preceding rule, that is, of the square on the tṛkarani).
  The areas (of the squares) produced separately by the length and the breadth of a rectangle together equal the area (of the square) produced by the diagonal.
  1.13 This is observed in rectangles having sides 3 and 4, 12 and 5, 15 and 8, 7
  and 24, 12 and 35, 15 and 36.

  If it is desired to combine two squares of different measures, a (rectangular) part is cut off from the larger (square) with the side of the smaller; the diagonal of the cut-off (rectangular) part is the side of the combined square. (Alternatively: If it is desired to combine two squares of different measures, a rectangle is formed with the side of the smaller (square)TRANSLATION-

  (as breadth) and that of the larger (as length); the diagonal of the rectangle (thus formed) is the side of the combined square).
  If it is desired to remove a square from another, a (rectangular) part is cut off from the larger (square) with the side of the smaller one to be removed; the (longer) side of the cut-off (rectangular) part is placed across so as to touch the opposite side; by this contact (the side) is cut off. With the cut-off (part) the difference (of the two squares) is obtained.
  A square intended to be transformed into a rectangle is cut off by its diagonal. One portion is divided into two (equal) parts which are placed on the two sides (of the other portion) so as to fit (them exactly).
  Or else, if a square is to be transformed (into a rectangle), (a segment) of it is to be cut off by the side (of the rectangle); what is left out (of the square) is added to the other side. (Like Ã§l. 3.1, the rule is defective and does not lead to proper geometrical operation).
  If it is desired to transform a rectangle into a square, its breadth is taken as the side of a square (and this square on the breadth is cut off from the rectangle). The remainder (of the rectangle) is divided into two equal parts and placed on two sides (one part on each). The empty space (in the corner) is filled up with a (square) piece. The removal of it (of the square piece from the square thus formed to get the required square) has been stated.
  If it is desired to reduce one side of a square (that is, to make an isosceles trapezium) the reduced side is to be taken as the breadth (of a rectangular portion to be cut off from the square); the remaining part (of the square) is divided by the diagonal and (one half), after being inverted, is placed on the other side.
  If it is desired to transform a square into (an isosceles) triangle, the square whose area is to be so transformed is doubled and a pole fixed at the middle of its east side; two cords with their ties fastened to it (the pole) are stretched to south-western and north-western corners (of the square); portions lying outside the cords are cut off.
  If it is desired to transform a square into a double (isosceles) triangle (that is, rhombus), a rectangle twice as large as the square to be so transformed is made; a pole is fixed at the middle of its east side; two cords with their ties fastened to it (the pole) are stretched to the middle points of the southern and northern side (of the rectangle); portions lying outside the cords are cut off; thereby the (isosceles) triangle on the other side is explained.
  If it is desired to transform a square into a circle, (a cord of length) half the diagonal (of the square) is stretched from the centre to the east (a part of it lying outside the eastern side of the square); with one-third (of the part lying outside) added to the remainder (of the half diagonal), the (required) circle is drawn,

  2.10 To transform a circle into a square, the diameter is divided into eight parts;
  one (such) part after being divided into twentynine parts is reduced by twentyeight of them and further by the sixth (of the part left) less the eighth (of the sixth part).
  2.11 Alternatively, divide (the diameter) into fifteen parts and reduce it by two of
  them; this gives the approximate side of the square (desired).
  2.12 The measure is to be increased by its third and this (third) again by its own fourth less the thirtyfourth part (of that fourth); this is (the value of) the diagonal of a square (whose side is the measure).

  Now, the placement of the ahavaniya from the garhapatya in the arrangement for the laying of sacrificial fires (will be discussed). According to tradition, the Brāhmaṇa has to place this fire ( āhavaniya ) ( at a distance of) 8 prakramas, the prince 11 prakramas and the merchant 12 prakramas (from the gārhapatya towards east).
  Three squares of side one-third the distance (between the āhavaniya and the gārhapatya) are made so as to be in contact with each other (along the east- west line); the gārhapatya (fire) lies at the north-west and the dakṣiṇāgni (anvāhāryapacana) at the south-east corner of the western square; the north- east corner of the eastern square marks the place of the āhavanîya.
  Alternatively, the distance between the garhapatya and the ahavaniya is divided into five or six (equal) parts, a sixth or a seventh part is added, the whole (of the cord measuring the original distance plus the added part) is divided into three (equal) parts, and a mark is given at the end of the second part from the eastern extremity. (With two ties) fastened to (poles at) the two ends of (the distance between) the gārhapatya and the āhavanīja, the cord is stretched to the south by the mark and a pole fixed at (the spot reached by) the mark. This is the place of the dakṣiņāgni.
  Or else, the measure (between the āhavaniya and the gārhapatya) is increased by its fifth, the whole of it is divided into five parts, and a mark is given at the end of the second part from the western extremity. With two ties fastened to (poles at) the two ends of the east-west line (representing the distance between the two fires), the cord is stretched to the south by the mark and a a pole fixed at (the spot reached by) the mark. This is the place of the dakṣināgni.
  The utkara is explained by doing the opposite (that is, by reversing the cord and stretching it to the north).
  To the west of the āhavaniya, as per tradition, is the altar for the new and full moon sacrifice (dārśapaurṇamāsa), measuring 96 angulas (yajamānamātrī) (in the east-west direction).

  This (measure) less its third (64 angulas) forms the western side (of the altar) and half the measure (48 angulas) the eastern side; after making in this way a rectangle shorter on one side, poles are fixed at the (four) corners.
  A tie is given at each end of a cord twice as long as the side (of the above altar) and a mark at the middle. With two ties fastened to (poles at the two ends of) the southern side, the cord is stretched to the south by the mark and a pole fixed at (the spot reached by) the mark. Fixing the two ties at this (pole), the southern side is circumscribed (with an arc of a circle from end to end) by the mark. Thereby the northern side is explained. The eastern side is circumscribed in the same way by a cord double its length, and likewise the western side.
  The tradition has it that the altar for animal sacrifice (pasubandha) has 10 padas on its western side, 12 padas as its east-west line (prācī) and 8 padas on its eastern side; how it is to be measured out has been explained. According to some, the altar is measured with the measures of a chariot (that is, with akṣa (104 angulas) for the western side, iṣā (188 angulas) for the prăci, and yuga (86 angulas) for the eastern side). According to others, the sides are 10 padas each.
  3.10 According to tradition, the uttara vedi is four-cornered and measured (on each side) by a śamyā (36 angulas); in the absence of any particular direction, it is a square.
  3.11
  According to tradition, the paitṛki vedi (used for performing pitr-rites) is formed with the third part. The third part of the mahāvedi is turned into a square; the side which produces one-third of this square makes that (of the paitṛki vedi). Therefore, it is one-ninth of the area (of the mahāvedi). According to others, its side measures 96 angulas (yajamānamātrī) and it is four-cornered, the corners being pointed to the four cardinal directions.
  3.12 For performing the sautrāmaṇī sacrifice, the altar is advised to have an area one-third of the mahāvedi. If a third part of the mahāvedi is turned into a square its side will be 18 padas. It can also have, if one so desires, a shape in which one side is shorter and the other larger.

  The sacrificial chamber (prāgvamsa) is 16 prakramas long by 12 prakramas broad, or else 12 prakramas long by 10 prakramas broad.
  (A length of) 12 prakramas is left in the middle between the sacrificial fires.
  According to tradition, the mahāvedi measures 30 padas or prakramas on its western side, 36 (padas or prakramas) along the east-west line and 24 (padas or prakramas) on its eastern side; how it is to be measured out has been explained. The mahāvedi is 6 prakramas from the āhavanīya (fire towards east).

  The sadas (shed) lies 1 prakrama from there (east of the western edge of the mahāvedi) and is 10 prakramas wide (in the east-west direction) and 27 aratnis, according to another opinion, 18 aratnis long in the south-north direction.
  The havirdhāna (shed for the soma-vehicles) lies 4 prakramas (to the east) from there; it is a square of 10 or 12 prakramas; how it (such a square) is to be measured out has been explained.
  The uttara vedi is measured out at a distance of half a prakrama to the west of the pole of the yūpāvaṭa (sacrificial post fixed in pit). According to soma- sacrifice, the uttara vedi measures 10 padas; how it is to be measured has been explained.
  The cātvāla (pit in the ground) measures 36 añgulas, or it may have any undefined measure.
  The uparavas (holes over which the soma is ground) are each 1 prādeśa long, the distance between two of them being 1 prādeśa. A square of side equalling 1 aratni is made, poles are fixed at the (four) corners, and a circle of radius equal to half pradeśa is drawn (with each pole at the corner as centre).
  Situated at a distance of 2 prakramas from the eastern half of the sadas (shed), the dhiṣṇya (fires) are each 2 prādeśas in diameter and separated from each other by the same distance (of 2 prādesas).
  The side of the (covered) place for (kindling) the āgnīdhra (sacrificial fire) is 5 aratnis.

  explained; its door is made on the northern side.

  The pits for sacrificial posts are (placed) at intervals of 1 akṣa (104 añgulas) and there are eleven of them as per tradition. The twentyfourth part of the sum of 10 akṣas, 11 padas and 8 añgulas is the prakrama. With this the altar is to be measured.
  For the asvamedha (horse sacrifice), the twentyfourth part of the sum of 20 aksas, 21 padas and 8 angulas is the prakrama. With this the altar is to
  be measured.
  For the making of 11 pits along the eastern side, a strip of breadth half a pada is cut off from the eastern half of the mahāvedi and placed east of it in the east-west direction. In this (operation) 8 angulas are not taken into account, and there is no mutual connection.
  4.15 The pits for the sacrificial posts are 1 pada (each) in diameter; the
  circumference of the base of the pits is 3 padas.

  puruşa). Thus by successively adding one-fold (1 square purușa), (one can go) upto 101-fold. Thus it begins with the 7-fold fire-altar (7 square purușa) and ends with the 101-fold.
  Thereafter, to continue further, the 101-fold (fire-altar) is to be repeated (that is, after reaching 101-fold, no further increase is to be made). Otherwise, the sacrificial rite is to be performed without a fire-altar.
  The aśvamedha (sacrifice) is an exception. If the aśvamedha (requiring a fire- altar of 21 square purușa) is performed without (the required agni) being reached, one fold is added to get the next higher fold (that is, 221⁄2 sq. puruşa agni); no other procedure is allowed.
  If (the required fire-altar is) surpassed, the fire-altar following the one surpassed is to be constructed.
  But how is one fold to be added ?
  The excess (to be added) to the original form (of the fire-altar) should be divided into 15 parts and two parts be added to each fold (of 1 sq. puruṣa; after 14 parts are in this way added to 7 folds of 7 sq. purușa, the remaining part is added to sq. puruşa). The (new) fire-altar is to be laid with such (increased) 7 folds.
  The height (of the fire-altar), according to some teaching, should be increased by the twenty-fourth part of the fifth of a jānu (32 añgulas).
  Some construct the fire-altar from one fold (11⁄2 sq. puruşa) upwards (upto 61⁄2 sq. purușa) without wings and tail.
  This is not justified because it contradicts earlier and later precepts.
  In this connection some Brāhmaṇas maintain that among the fire-altars the making of the falcon-shaped one is the first sacrificial ceremony.
  Other Brāhmaṇas maintain that after having constructed a larger fire-altar a smaller one should not be laid.
  Our Brāhmaṇa teaches as follows: he is winged for the unwinged cannot fly; the two wings are longer (than 1 purușa in each case) by 1 aratni, and this makes the birds strong in their wings; the two wings and the tail measure 1 vyāma (each).
  A falcon without wings and tail does not exist; so the fire-altar which is not seven-fold has neither wings nor tail; moreover, the construction of one-fold fire-altar after the seven-fold has been laid is inadmissible; for all this the seven-fold is the fire-altar to be made for the first time.
  The clefts are to be avoided; the meetings of edges (between bricks) in the upper and lower layer constitute these clefts, as per teachings. Such clefts, however, do not exist either in the peripheries or the two sides of a corner of the fire-altar.

  The fire-altar indeed possesses the characteristics of an animal. The southern bones of an animal are on its southern (right) side; likewise its northern bones lie on its northern (left) side and vice versa. That (part) which is below (on the western side) is the same as what is above (on the eastern side). In the same manner bricks of different forms are to be placed (in the fire-altar).
  (Bricks marked with) lines turned to the right are placed on the southern side, those with lines turned to the left on the northern side, those with straight lines on the east and the west side, and those with three lines in the middle (of the fire-altar). The placing (of the bricks) in the middle (along the east-west line of the fire-altar) is to be understood in the same way as the backbone of the animal which does not lie more on one side than the other (but passes strictly along the middle of its body).
  On this the Brāhmaṇa has it that Prajapati indeed is Atharvan and Agni is Dadhyan, son of Atharvan, and the bricks are his bones.
  (In a fire-altar) where exterior limbs (such as head, wings, tail, feet etc.) are to be fitted (to the body, that is, the ātman of the altar), the middle of the side of the limb (concerned) is to be joined to the middle of that side of the body with which it (the limb) is to be in contact.
  According to tradition, it (the fire-altar) is to be laid (with its head) towards the east.
  The number of bricks is not to be completed with those which are not made of clay or which are not bricks.
  As per teachings of this Brāhmaṇa, one fire-altar is laid with bricks, another with animals.
  For the fire-altar has the characteristics of an animal: the yoni of an animal is of different forms; before laying the bricks, the sacrificial formulas from the Yajus text are recited.
  Things occupying space are to be placed in holes (in the ground).

  If the number of sacrificial formulas (recited) falls short of the number of bricks, the difference is to be made good by (the sacrificial formulas called) lokampṛņas because their number is unspecified.

  6.13 (There are) five lokampṛņas (in every fire-altar).

In the layer where a brick full of natural holes (svayamātṛṇṇa) is used it is not to be covered (by a brick).
  The height of the brick is to be made a fifth of the jānu (that is, 6% angula); that of the nākasat and the pañcacoḍā half of that measure (that is, 3 añgula).
  What is lost by drying and burning is to be made good by loose earth because of the flexibility of its quantity.
  According to tradition, the gārhapatya fire has the measure of 1 vyāyāma. It (gārhapatya fire) is a square by one tradition and a circle by another.
  The (garhapatya fire in the form of) square is to be divided into 7 parts (length- wise) and then into 3 parts transversely. In the second layer, bricks are to be placed towards north (that is, the division in the first layer as aforesaid is to be reversed).
  To place square bricks (instead of rectangular ones as indicated above), (square) bricks of sides one-sixth, one-fourth and one-third of 1 vyāyāma are made. Of them, 9 bricks of the first type and 12 of the second are placed in the first layer; 5 of the third type and 16 of the first are placed in the second layer.

  The dhiṣnya fires are one-layered in the form of a square or a circle.

  The dhisnya fire of the hoty priest is divided into 9 parts and the 3 parts on the eastern side are divided into 2 parts each.
  The others (dhiṣṇya fires) are each divided into 9 parts and then two parts, one in the centre and the other in the east, are combined.
  Now the mārjālīya fire is divided into 3 parts and then the eastern and the western parts (taken together) are divided into 5 parts.
  The bricks are to be made by mixing with ashes from the caldron.

"To distinguish between the divine and the human (purposes), the fire-altar is to be constructed with square bricks',-thus feaches the Maitrāyaṇī Brāhmaṇa.
For (constructing) this (fire-altar), (square) bricks (of sides) the fourth, the fifth, the sixth and the tenth part (of a purușa, that is 30, 24, 20 and 12 angulas respectively) are made.
Now the (area of the) fire-altar is measured out.
Two holes are made on a bamboo rod at a distance equal to the height of a man with uplifted arms; a third hole is made at the middle. What (measure- ment) is done elsewhere with the cord is done here with the bamboo rod.
The body (of the fire-altar) is a square of 4 purușa; its (southern) wing is a square of 1 puruşa made longer on the southern side by 1 aratni and its northern wing is explained in the same way; its tail is a square of 1 puruşa lengthened on the western side by 1 prādeśa. Thus, with the addition of (two) aratnis and (one) prādeśa, the seven-fold (fire-altar of 71⁄2 sq. puruṣa) is accomplished.
In the placement (of bricks) at a distance of one-third puruşa (40 añgulas) to the north from the end of the (southern) wing, 4 bricks of side equal to one- fifth (of a purușa) and 2 quarter bricks (one-fourth of the area of a pañcami brick, that is, 12 sq. angula) (are placed). Thereafter 8 bricks of side equal to one-fourth (of a purușa) (are placed). The remaining space of the (southern) wing is covered with bricks of side equal to one-sixth (of a purușa). Thereby the northern wing is explained.
8.12 Bricks of side equal to one-fourth (of a purușa) are to be placed on the eastern and the western side of the tail, and quarter bricks on its southern and northern side. The remaining space of the fire-altar is to be covered with bricks of side equal to one-fifth (of a purușa).

Now another type (of square fyenacit).
(For this are required bricks of side equal to) one-fifth (pañcami) of a purușa; (those) with one side longer by half (adhyardha) of one-fifth (of a purușa); (these equal to) a half of its size (ardhyā of the pañcami); and (those equal to) a quarter of its size (pādyā of the pañcami).
In the placement (of bricks), half bricks (half of pañcami) turned towards north are placed on the eastern and the western side of the (southern) wing; the same (is done) for the northern (wing).
4 bricks longer by half and turned towards north (are placed) on each of the southern and northern side of the tail; 4 half bricks turned towards north (are placed) on the western side of the tail; and 2 quarter bricks on either side of them (that is, in two corners of the tail's west end). 1 half brick turned towards east (is to be placed) at each of the two places where the tail is joined with the hind part (of the body) (that is, at two corners of the eastern side of the tail).
The rest of the fire-altar is to be covered with pañcami (bricks).
This is one layer of 200 bricks.
In the other layer, 4 quarter bricks (are placed) on each in the 4 corners of the body; 2 half bricks on two sides of them (in each corner); 5 half bricks on the eastern front (of the body).
At the end of each wing, 3 bricks longer by half (are placed) oriented towards north and 1 half brick (is placed) in each of the interstices between them (adhyardha bricks).
The rest of the fire-altar is to be covered with pañcami (bricks).
This is (another) layer of 200 bricks. (With these two layers) alternating with each other, as many layers as desired are to be constructed.

Now (is described the construction of a fire-altar in the form of a falcon) with curved wings and extended tail.
10.2 Bricks for this (fire-altar) are made with side equal to one-fourth (caturthi) of a purusa; (then those equal to) a half of its size (ardhya of caturthi) and a quarter of its size (padya of caturthi). The cutting (of the caturthi brick to obtain its half and quarter) is always to be done diagonally in the absence of any advice to the contrary.TRANSLATION

10.6
(Then one should make) quarter bricks (with the same area as that of a caturthi-pādyā) bounded by four sides (measuring) § pada, 1 pada, 11⁄2 pada and √/2 pada. Two of them touching each other along their long sides (11⁄2 pada) are made into (another) half brick (called hamsamukhi, swan beaked, with the same area as that of a caturthī-ardhyā).
The fire-altar is now measured out. The body is 2 purușas (240 añgulas) in length by 10 padas (150 añgulas) in breadth. From its south-eastern corner towards north a mark is given at a distance of 11⁄2 prakrama (45 añgulas); the same (is done) towards west. By stretching a cord over these (two marks), the (south-eastern) corner is to be cut off. Thereby is explained the cutting off of other (three) corners. This makes the body (ātman).
The head is of 5 padas (82) angulas) in length by purusa (60 angulas) in breadth. The two eastern corners of it are cut off with 1 prakrama (30 angulas).
The tail measures 6 padas (90 angulas) in the east-west and 2 purușas (240 angulas) in the south-north direction. The two eastern corners of it are cut off with 3 prakramas (90 añgulas) each.
10.7 The (southern) wing is of 12 padas (180 añgulas) in length (along north-south) and 10 padas (150 angulas) in breadth (along east-west). A pole is fixed at a distance of 6 padas (90 añgulas) to the east from the middle (of its western side) and at each of the two south-western corners (of the rectangular wing). With a cord (stretching between these three poles, a triangular area) is to be enclosed. The (triangular) area enclosed by the cord is to be cut off and placed on the eastern side (of the wing) (with its vertex) pointing towards east. This is the bending (of the wing). Thereby the bending of the northern wing is explained.
10.8
At the end of each wing, 5 squares of side equal to 1 prakrama (30 añgulas) are laid (in a row) so as to be in contact with each other; all of them are intersected diagonally in the downward direction (by joining the north- east corner to the south-east); and a half portion is removed (from each square).
10.9 Thus, with the addition of (two) aratnis and (one) prādeśa, the seven-fold
(fire-altar of 71⁄2 sq. purușa) is accomplished.
10.10 In the placement (of bricks), 1 caturthi is to be placed in the head at its junction (with the body) and 1 hamsamukhi (swan-beaked) to the east of it. 2 quarter bricks are placed on two sides (of the hamsamukhi), 3 four-sided quarter bricks below them on each side (of the head), and quarter bricks in the remaining space (of the head).
10.11 Alternatively, 1 hamsamukhī brick is to be placed at the (eastern) extremity of the head and 1 caturthi below it, to be flanked by 1 quarter brick on either side. 3 four-sided quarter bricks are placed to the west (of these two quarter

10.12 5 quarter bricks mutually joined with one another are to be placed to the west of the head (on the eastern end of the body) and the same to the east of the tail (on the western end of the body). Half bricks as well as quarter bricks are to be placed in the truncated parts.
10.13 The rest of the fire-altar is to be covered with caturthi bricks. The number (of 200 bricks) is to be completed with quarter bricks and half bricks.
10.14 This is one layer of 200 bricks.
10.15 In the other layer, 4 hamsamukhi bricks are to be joined with 4 quarter bricks so as to form a rectangle; this is placed breadth-wise in the space of the svayamātṛṇņa.
10.16 At the junction of the tail (with the body), 2 hamsamukhi bricks, (with their vertices) turned towards west and their pāda sides lying within the body, are to be placed and below them and on both sides 3 quarter bricks (with their vertices) turned towards east.
10.17 At the western end of the tail 15 quarter bricks mutually joined with one
another are to be placed.
10.18 In the plumages of the wing 2 quarter bricks alternating with 1 half brick are
to be placed (from the west) to the east.
10.19 In the truncated areas at the joints (between the body and the wing, the
bendings of the wing etc.), half bricks and quarter bricks are to be placed.
10.20 The rest of the fire-altar is to be covered with caturthi bricks. The number (of 200 bricks) is to be completed with quarter bricks and half bricks.

11.1
Now another type (of falcon-shaped fire-altar with curved wings and extended tail).
11.2 (In this case) the seven-fold (fire-altar) with (two) aratnis and (one) prādeśa is accomplished with 187 (square bricks) of side equal to one-fifth of a puruşa (pañcami).
11.3 The body can accommodate 52 of such (pañcamī bricks), the head 31, the
tail 15, southern wing 581 and the northern wing the same (number of bricks as the southern).
11.4 The corners (of the rectangular body) are cut off with vyāyāma (48 añgulas); the tail is inclined; the bending of the two wings is done with 3 aratnis (72 angulas) each; the six plumages (at each end of the wings) are to be made with the half of bricks longer on one side by half (that is, half of adhyardhā-

pañcami); the form of the head remains unchanged (that is, the same as that of the falcon-shaped fire-altar described before).
The different types of bricks (required for this fire-altar) are as follows. Bricks of side equal to one-fifth of a puruşa (pañcami, 24 ang, × 24 ang.); bricks of which one side is longer by half (adhyardhā) (36 ang. × 24 añg.); bricks of which one side is longer by a quarter (sapādā, 30 ang. × 24 añg.); bricks which are quarter in size of those with side equal to one-fifth (of a purușa) (pañcami-pādyā); bricks which are half in size (of the above, e.g., pañcamî- ardhyā); likewise, of bricks with side longer by half (that is, half and two types of quarter bricks made out of adhyardhās); triangular bricks made by joining two eighth parts, one from each of them (the eighth part of a pañcami to be joined with the eighth part of an adhyardhā, called ubhayi); and bricks of which one eighth the size of those with side equal to one-fifth (of a purușa). These are the ten (different types).
The pañcami bricks and their halves are to be placed in the body and the same in the tail.
The adhyardhā bricks and their halves (are to be placed) in the two wings.
11.9 In the head (are to be placed) such bricks as are possible (as can be
accommodated).
11.10 In the other layer, 1 ubhay brick (formed by combining the eighth part of
a pañcami with the eighth part of an adhyardhā) is to be placed at the eastern end of the (line of) junction of each wing (with the body); 1 ubhayi brick each at the western end (of the same line of junction); and 2 ubhayī bricks are to be placed on each side of the head.
11.11 At the western end of the tail, adhyardhā bricks (with the longer side) turned towards east, and at the two sides (western corners), bricks of size one-fourth and one-eighth (of a pañcami) (are to be placed).
11.12 Adhyardhā bricks and parts thereof (are to be placed) in the two wings.
11.13 The remaining space (of the fire-altar) is to be filled with bricks such that these fit, the required number (of 200 bricks in the layer) is attained and the properties (of the fire-altar) are satisfied.

The bending of the two wings is done with 1 vyāyāma plus 1 prādeśa (that is, with 108 añgulas). 6 plumages (at each end of the two wings) are to be formed with 6 pañcamī half bricks. (An area equivalent to) 11⁄2 pañcami is left.
With this (area left out), two feet each measuring 1 aratni (24 angulas) long by 1 prādeśa (12 angulas) broad are made on the western end of the tail at a distance of 1 aratni from each other; at each side of the western end (of each foot) 2 bricks of size one-eighth (of the pañcami) (are placed).
Thus, with the addition of (two) aratnis and (one) prādeśa, the seven-fold (fire-altar of 71⁄2 sq. purușa) is accomplished.
The different types of bricks (required for this fire-altar) are as follows: bricks of side equal to one-fifth (of a purușa) and parts thereof (half, quarter and one-eighth of pañcami bricks); quarter bricks (having the area of a quarter pañcami) bounded by four sides (measuring )1⁄2 prādeśa (6 angulas), 11⁄2 prādeśa (18 angulas), 1 prādeśa (12 angulas) and √2 prādeśa (12 √2 añgulas); adhyardhā bricks (having the area of 11⁄2 pañcami) bounded by four sides (measuring) vyāyāma (48 angulas), 1 aratni (24 angulas), 1 aratni (24 añgulas) and √2 aratni (24 √2 añgulas). These make six (types).
Of them, four-sided quarter bricks together with the one-eighths are placed in two feet, and the remaining space is to be filled with bricks such that these fit, the required number (of 200 bricks in the layer) is attained and the properties (of the fire-altar) are satisfied.

The bending of the two wings is done with 1 purușa (120 añgulas).
From (a pole fixed at a distance of) 1 aratni (24 angulas) towards east from the western bend, a cord is stretched along the (line of) intersection of the westernmost plumage, and (the part lying west of the cord) cut off.
In this way (an area equivalent to) 51⁄2 pañcami (bricks) stands removed.
1 quarter brick is placed at each western bend (to fill up the triangular void caused by the aforesaid removal). Out of the brick types the four-sided quarter bricks and the one-eighths are to be taken away, and the remaining space (of the fire-altar) is to be filled with (remaining types of) bricks such that these fit, the required number (of 200 bricks in the layer) is attained and the properties (of the fire-altar) are satisfied.

A fire-altar in the form of an isosceles triangle (prauga) is to be constructed as follows.
An isosceles triangle equal in area to the (seven-fold) fire-altar with (two) aratnis and (one) pradeśa (that is, 7 sq. purușa) is laid. Bricks (called bṛhati) of length equal to one-twelfth of its western side and breadth equal to half (of the length) are to be made; then bricks which are half and quarter (of the bṛhatis).
Of them, two half bricks with their hypotenuses turned outwards are to be placed in the apex and half bricks on both sides.
The rest of the fire-altar is to be covered with bṛhati and the number (of 200 bricks) is to be completed with half bricks.
In the other layer, 47 quarter bricks mutually joined with one another are to be placed on the western side (of the triangle).
1 sulapādyā (short-based quarter brick) in the apex (is to be placed).
14.7 4 quarter bricks,—2 wide-based (dirghapādyā) and 2 of the other type (e.g. short-based, sulapādyā), are to be placed in the space of the svayamātṛnṇa, and half bricks on the two sides.

A rhombus equal in area to the (seven-fold) fire-altar with (two) aratnis and (one) prādesa (that is, 7 sq. puruşa) is laid. As in the case of fire-altar in the form of isosceles triangle, bricks and their variations are to be made with the ninth part of the breadth (of the rectangle used for the construction of the rhombus).

According to tradition, a fire-altar in the form of a chariot wheel is to be constructed.
The chariot wheels are indeed of two types, e.g. those with spokes and those (formed) by the joining of circular segments (to a central square piece). In the absence of any distinction between the two, both are taken into consi- deration and described.
Now the (area of the) fire-altar is measured out. A circle of area equal to that of the (seven-fold) fire-altar with (two) aratnis and (one) prādeśa is made, the largest possible square is inscribed in it, and bricks are made with the twelfth part of its side.
6 of these (bricks) are placed in each circular segment and the remaining space (of the segment) is divided into 8 parts.
The other layer is to be so oriented that the corners (of the square) lie in the centres of the segments (of the first layer).
Now the other type.
16.7 Square bricks of area equal to the fifteenth part of half a (square) puruşa are
made for purposes of measurement.
16.8
16.9
With 225 of them (of such bricks) is accomplished the seven-fold (fire- altar) with (two) aratnis and (one) prādeśa.
To these (225 bricks) another 64 (bricks of the same kind) are added and with them (289 bricks) a square is made (as follows). (At first) a square is made with a side containing 16 bricks (in which 256 bricks are used up), leaving a balance of 33 bricks. These (33 bricks) are placed on all sides (actually on two adjoining sides, so as to obtain a square of side containing 17 bricks).
16.10 16 (bricks) at the centre constitute the nave; 64 (bricks thereafter) constitute the spokes and 64 the empty spaces (between spokes); the remaining (145 bricks) form the felly.
16.11 (The square shaped) nave at its borders is transformed into a circle (by the method previously described). The outer and the inner (squares) enclosing the felly are transformed into (two) circles. After dividing the space between the felly and the nave into 32 equal parts, the alternate ones are removed. In this way, the added area (equivalent of 64 bricks) stands withdrawn.
TRANSLATION
95
16.12 After dividing the felly into 64 equal parts and drawing (radial) lines (through these divisions), a circle is drawn through the middle (of the felly), making the number (of parts in the felly) equal to 128.
16.13 The spokes are each divided into 4 parts; the nave is divided into 8 parts. 16.14 This is the first layer (of 200 parts or bricks).
16.15 In the other layer, a circle is to be drawn within the nave at a distance equal to one-fourth (of the radius) from its inner edge. The same (is to be done) within the felly (at a distance equal to one-fourth of the felly's breadth) from the inner circumference.
16.16 After dividing the inner edge of the felly (that is, the circle drawn within it) into 64 equal parts, (radial) lines are to be drawn (so as to divide the felly into 64 parts).
16.17 (The space in each of) the spokes is divided into 5 parts from circle (in the
nave) to circle (in the felly).
16.18 The space in each interstice of the felly is divided into 2 parts, and there is
1 part in each interstice of the nave.
16.19 The remaining space of the nave is to be divided into 8 parts.
16.20 These are the 16 types (of bricks required) in (the construction of) the fire-
altar in the form of a chariot wheel with spokes,

17.1 According to tradition, a fire-altar in the form of a trough is to be constructed.

Now the (area of the) fire-altar is measured out. The body is a square of side equal to 2 purusas.
Its handle lies at the western side (of the body) and is § purușa and 10 añgulas (that is, 70 angulas) long towards east and purușa (80 añgulas) broad towards north.
17.5 Thus, with the addition of (two) aratnis and (one) prādeśa, the seven-fold
(fire-altar of 7 sq. purusas) is accomplished.
17.6
The different types of bricks (required for this fire-altar) are as follows: bricks of side equal to 1/6 purușa (ṣaṣṭhi); bricks of side longer on one side by half (adhyardha), half bricks (of the saṣṭhi) transversely cut; and bricks of side equal to puruşa (caturthi).

In the other layer, 1 adhyardha is to be placed in the south-eastern corner and the same on the north-eastern.
17.9 Şaşṭhi bricks are to be placed on the eastern front (between the 2 adhyardhās).
17.10 Bricks of side equal to 1 purușa (caturthi) are to be placed on the southern

120 (square) bricks, each of a (square) puruşa (ṣoḍaśī, side ang.) give the area of the seven-fold (fire-altar of 71⁄2 sq. purușa) with (two) aratnis and (one) prādeśa.
One of them is taken away, and (the area equivalent to) the remaining (119 bricks) is transformed into a circle.
This (kind of transformation into circle) has been explained in the case of the fire-altar in the form of a chariot wheel of the first type.
The ṣoḍaśi (brick which is taken away) is placed in the middle of the east side (of the square equivalent to the area of 119 bricks) and with it the circle (of the same area as that of the square) is to be drawn.
The western part (of the ṣoḍaśī brick) cut off (by the circle) is placed on its eastern side.
18.7 The (four) circular segments (obtained by drawing the maximum possible square within the above circle and after placing 6 bricks of side equal to 1/12 of the side of the inscribed square on the base of the segment, as in the case of the chariot wheel) are each divided into 7 parts.
18.8

Bricks in the middle of the segments are each 1 prakrama (30 añgulas) wide.
The number (of 200 bricks) is to be completed by bricks half of the square bricks (made with 1/12 of the side of the inscribed square).
TRANSLATION

18.10 In the other layer, the brick in the middle of the (eastern) segment is placed in the lip (-shaped handle) and the space below it is divided into 2 equal parts.
18.11 This is the fire-altar in the form of a circular trough involving (the use of)
nine types (of bricks).
18.12 The construction of the samuhya and the paricayya (fire-altars) is explained in the same way as that of the fire-altar in the form of the chariot wheel as already discussed.
18.13 Pits are dug out in the (four) cardinal directions of (the space to be occupied by) the samuhya, and the earth is collected from them and placed on the samuhya (instead of the bricks).
18.14- The positioning of bricks in the paricāyya is different (from that of the chariot 18.15 wheel); these are placed all around in (concentric) circles turning towards
right.

19.1 According to tradition, a fire-altar in the form of a pyre (śmaśānacit) is to
be constructed.
19.2
19.3
The entire (area of the) fire-altar is divided into 15 square-parts. How to do this has been stated.
A rectangle is made with its length equal to thrice (the side of) the square- part and breadth equal to half (the side of the square-part). Lines are drawn from the middle of its eastern side to the two western corners and the two outer parts are removed (so as to obtain an isosceles triangle). This (isosceles triangle) is divided into 10 parts.
19.4 The entire fire-altar is composed of 20 of them (of such isosceles triangles).
19.5 In the other layer, one of the (five) isosceles triangles (into which the entire fire-altar can be divided) is to be vertically bisected. Each half is divided into 6 parts. These two (half isosceles triangles each divided into 6 parts) are to be placed on either side (the southern and the northern side of the fire-altar).
19.6
Bricks of length equal to one-third (the side of the square part) and breadth equal to one-fourth (the side of the square part) are to be made, and then half of such bricks by transverse bisection.
19.7 After placing them (the half bricks) on the two ends (the eastern and the western), the rest of the fire-altar is to be covered with the bṛhatī bricks turned towards east, and the number (of 200 bricks) is to be completed with half bricks.
19.8 The height of the fire-altar is to be increased by one-fifth (of the jānu, that
is, 63 angula).
98
19.9
BAUDHAYANA-SULBASUTRA
The whole of it (the height including the added 5th part) is divided into three parts and bricks are made with the fourth or the ninth or the four- teenth part of the two of these three parts (according as the fire-altar is intended to have 5, 10 or 15 layers).
19.10 With these bricks, 4 or 9 or 14 layers are made, the remaining layer (of thickness equal to one-third of the height) is diagonally cut in the downward direction and half of it removed.
19.11 Its division is exact. Larger and smaller bricks are taken according as these
fit.

The tortoises are indeed of two types, e.g. those with twisted limbs and those with rounded ones. In the absence of any distinction between the two, both are taken into consideration and described.
The fire-altar is measured out as follows. The body is a square of side equal to 10 prakramas (300 angulas); its corners are cut off with 2 prakramas (60 angulas) on each side.
4 squares each of side equal to 1 prakrama (30 angulas) are made in (the middle of) the eastern front and 2 of them lying at either extreme are cut off by their diagonals. The same is done on the southern, western and northern front. This is the body.
The head is 5 padas (75 añgulas) long by purușa (60 angulas) broad, of which the two eastern corners are to be cut off with 1 prakrama (30 añgulas) on each side.
The feet are to be raised where the corners (of the body) have been cut off. The foot (in the south-eastern corner) is 2√2 padas (30√/2 angulas) broad by twice that measure (that is, 60√2 añgulas) long and its eastern corner is cut off by 2√2 padas. Thereby is explained the cutting off of the other (three) feet. Of the two feet at the western (corners of the body), their western corners are to be cut off.
20.7 Thus, with the addition of (two) aratnis and (one) prādeśa, the seven-fold
(fire-altar of 7 sq. puruşa) is accomplished.
20.8
20.9
(Square) bricks of side equal to one-fourth of a purușa, and their halves and quarters (obtained by dividing the first type diagonally) are to be made for this (fire-altar).
(Then one should make) adhyardhā quarter (that is, one-fourth of caturthis longer on one side by half) bricks bounded by four sides (measuring) 1 prakrama, 1 pada, 1 pada and √2 pada.TRANSLATION

20.10 Two of them touching each other along their long sides (1 prakrama) are to
be made into another (type of) brick (hamsamukhi)..
20.11 (Then one should make) another (type of) square brick of side equal to half
of 2√2 pada (that is, √2 pada or 15√2 añgulas).
20.12 In the placement (of bricks), a square brick (of side equal to 15√2 añgulas) is to be placed at the top of the head, followed by two hamsamukhi (bricks) below it.
20.13 5 square bricks and 2 quarter bricks (pañcamī-pādyā) are to be placed in
each foot.
20.14 Half bricks are to be placed wherever a corner has been cut off.
20.15 The rest of the fire-altar is to be covered with caturthi bricks. The number
(of 200 bricks) is to be completed with half bricks.
20.16 In the other layer, 1 hamsamukhi at the top of the head and 1 quarter brick
on either side of it are to be placed.
20.17 To the west of these on each side (of the head) 2 (four-sided) adhyardhā quarter
bricks oppositely oriented are to be placed.
20.18 To the west of these on both sides are to be placed 2 quarter (caturthi-pādyā)
bricks in alignment with the intersection.
20.19 2 caturthi (here called dvipadās or squares of side equal to 2 padas or 30 angulas)
and 3 half bricks are to be placed in each foot.
20.20 Half bricks and quarter bricks are to be placed wherever a corner has been
cut off.
20.21 The rest of the fire-altar is to be covered with caturthi bricks. The number
(of 200 bricks) is to be completed with half bricks.

Now the other type (of kūrmacit with rounded limbs).
120 (square) bricks of side equal to purușa (sodasi) give the area of the seven-fold (fire-altar of 73 sq. purușa) with (two) aratnis and (one) prādesa).
Of them 5 ṣoḍaśī bricks are taken away, and (the area equivalent to) the remaining (115 bricks) is transformed into a circle. This (kind of transforma- tion into a circle) has been explained in the case of the fire-altar in the form of a trough of the second type.
With 5 ṣoḍaśī bricks, (four) feet in (four) intermediate directions and the head in the east are to be raised. How to round off these bricks (for fitting with the circular body) has been explained.
The (four) circular segments (obtained by drawing the maximum possible square within the above circle and after placing 6 bricks of side equal to

BAUDHÃYANA-ŚULBASŪTRA
of the side of the inscribed square on the base of the segment as in the case of the trough) are each divided into 7 parts. Bricks in the middle of the segments are each 1 prakrama (30 añgulas) wide.
21.6 The resulting bricks in excess (of 200) are adjusted by square bricks longer
by half on one side (adhyardhā).
21.7
In the other layer, the feet are divided in the same manner as the head (in the first layer) and the head is divided like the feet (as in the first layer).
21.8 Alternating with each other as many layers as desired are to be constructed.
21.9 A little loose earth is to be placed on the edge of the tortoise (-shaped fire- altar) and a large quantity in the middle of it. In the (fire-altar in the form of) trough, the oposite is the case.
21.10 According to some (teachers), the fire-altars beginning with the one-fold
should be (in the form of) isosceles triangles.
21.11 According to some other (teachers), (these should be in the form of) squares. Bricks are to be made with of the side of the square and half and quarter bricks thereof.
21.12 The increase (in the area) of the fire-altar for the aśvamedha (sacrifice) takes
place by the purușa and not by (two) aratnis and (one) prādeŝa.
21.13 This (aśvamedha fire-altar) is original and three times as large. Being three times as large, this fire-altar is twentyone-fold, and such is the tradition contained in both the Brāhmaṇas.

We shall explain the methods of constructing (different) figures (on the ground for building sacrificial altars).
A cord of length equal to a given measure is increased by its half so that the whole length is divided into three parts of half the measure each. In the third part on the western side, a mark is given at a point shorter by one-sixth (of the third part). With the two ties fastened to the two ends of the east-west line (pṛṣṭhyā) the cord is stretched towards the south by the mark and a pole is fixed on it. The same is done towards the north. The same is repeated on the other side (eastern) after interchanging the ties. Thus are determined (the four corners of the right rectilinear figure). Thereby the sides are shortened or lengthened.
Alternatively, a cord of a given measure is increased by its length; the original length plus its fourth part will constitute the diagonal and the remaining (three-fourth part of the length) the breadth (of the rectangle). Thereby, the construction of a (right rectilinear) figure is explained.
The areas (of the squares) produced separately by the length and the breadth of a rectangle together equal the area (of the square) produced by the diagonal. By the understanding of these (methods) the construction of the figures as stated (is to be accomplished).
The diagonal of a square produces double the area (of the square). It is √2 (dvikaraņi) of the side of the square (of which it is the diagonal).
The measure is to be increased by its third and this (third) again by its own fourth less the thirty-fourth part (of the fourth); this is (the value of) the diagonal of a square (whose side is the measure).
Here is another method (of construction of a square). Ties are made at both ends of a cord of length equal to the given measure. Marks are given at its middle and at mid points of its two halves. After stretching the cord along the east-west line poles are fixed at the ties and the marks. With the two ties fixed at the two poles at the two outer marks (mid-points of two halves), the cord is stretched towards the south by the middle mark and a sign is given (at the point reached). With the two ties fixed at the middle pole, the cord is (again) stretched by its middle mark towards the south over the sign (previ- ously made) and a pole is fixed (at the point reached). With one tie (of the cord) fixed at this pole and the other tie at the eastern pole, the south- eastern corner is (now) obtained by (stretching the cord with) its middle mark. By removing the tie from the eastern pole and fixing it to the western pole, the south-western corner is likewise obtained by (stretching

2.7
ĀPASTAMBA-ŚULBASŪTRA
the cord with) the middle mark. In the same manner, the north-western and the north-eastern corners (are obtained).
2
Now another method of construction (of a square). Poles are fixed at both ends and in the middle of the east-west line. A cord measuring half of the east-west line is taken and increased by its viśeșa (the difference between its length and the diagonal of the square produced by it). After giving a mark at this point, the cord is (further) increased by half of the east-west line. Ties are made at both ends of the cord. Fixing the tie at the saviśeșa end at the middle pole and the other tie at the eastern pole, the cord is stretched by the mark so as to obtain the south-eastern corner. By removing the tie from the eastern pole and fixing it to the western pole, the south-western corner is likewise obtained by (stretching the cord with) the mark. In the same way, the north-western and the north-eastern corners (are obtained).
The breadth (of a rectangle) being the side of a given square (pramāṇa) and the length the side of a square twice as large (dvikaraṇī), the diagonal equals the side of a square thrice as large (tṛkarani).
Thereby is explained the side of a square one-third the area of a given square (tṛtiyakaraņi). It is the side of a square one-ninth the area of the square (explained in the preceding rule, that is, of the square on the tṛkaraṇī).
The combination of two equal squares has been described. The combination of two squares of unequal measures (sides) (now) follows. A (rectangular) part is cut off from the larger (square) with the side of the smaller; the diagonal of the cut-off (rectangular) part (produces the square which) combines both the squares. This has been stated.
If it is desired to remove a square from another, a (rectangular) part is cut off from the larger (square) with the side of the smaller one to be removed; the (longer) side of the cut-off (rectangular) part is placed across so as to touch the opposite side; by this contact (the side) is cut off. With the cut-off (part) the difference (of the two squares) is obtained.
That (the longer side of the cut-off rectangle in the above rule) which is placed across is the diagonal equal to the side of a square four times as large (as the given square). The area (of the squares) produced separately by the cut-off side and the other (the breadth of the rectangle) together equal the the area (of the square) produced by this diagonal. If the breadth produces one square purușa, the other side produces three square purușas. This has been stated.
If it is desired to transform a rectangle into a square, a (square) part is cut off (from the rectangle) by the breadth. The remainder (of the rectangle) is divided (into two equal parts) and placed on two sides. The empty space (in the corner) is filled up with a (square) piece. The removal of it (of the

If it is desired to transform a square into a rectangle, the side is made as long as desired; (after diagonal intersection), what remains as excess portion is to be placed where it fits. (Like Bśl. 2.4, the rule is defective and does not lead to proper geometrical operation).
If it is desired to transform a square into a circle, a cord is stretched from the centre (of the square) upto its corner (so as to measure out a length equal to half the diagonal). It is (then) stretched (from the centre) towards the (eastern) side. With one-third of the excess part (lying outside the eastern side) added (to the portion of the cord between the centre and the side), the (required) circle is drawn. This is the (approximate) circle, for (almost) as much is added as is cut off (from the corners of the square).
To transform a circle into a square, the diameter is divided into fifteen parts and two of them are removed, leaving thirteen parts. This gives the approxi- mate (side of the) square (desired).
The (square) measure is to be done by means of the (linear) measure. A square (of unit area) is to be understood in the absence of anything to the
contrary.
(A cord of length) twice the measure produces four (square measures); thrice the measure nine (square measures).
The number of units of measure in a cord is to be squared (to get the area of the square in that measure). (Alternatively, as many units of measure there are in a cord so many rows of squares on each side will be in a square of side equal to the measuring cord.) This is the meaning.
A cord 11⁄2 puruşa long makes 21 (square purușas); a cord of 21 purușas makes 61 (square puruṣas).
Now follows the method (of finding the area of a square) when the side is increased. With the side (of the given square) and the length by which the side is increased is drawn (a rectangular area) which is placed on either side. (of the square). A square is formed with the length by which the side is increased and placed in the corner (to produce the enlarged square whose area is the sum of the given square, the two rectangles and the corner square piece).
With half the side of a square, a square one-fourth in area is produced, because four such squares to complete the area (of the original square) are produced with twice the half side. With one-third the side of a square is produced its ninth part.

The distance between the gārhapatya and the āhavanīya in the arrangement for the laying of sacrificial fires is known from the tradition. The Brāhmaṇa has to place it (the āhavanīya) (at a distance of) 8 prakramas, the prince 11 prakramas and the merchant 12 prakramas (from the garhapatya towards east).
For general use and not for any particular class, this distance is indefinite, (about) 24 prakramas to be ascertained by eye estimation and should not deviate from it much.
According to tradition, the (place of the) dakṣiņāgni is near the south-east corner of the third part of the distance of the gārhapaṭya (from the āhavaniya).
The distance between the garhapatya and the āhavaniya is divided into five or six (equal) parts, a sixth or a seventh part is added, the whole (of the cord measuring the original distance plus the added part) is divided into three (equal) parts, and a mark is given at the end of the third part from the western end. (With two ties) fastened to (poles at) the two ends of (the distance between the gārhapatya and the āhavaniya, the cord is stretched to the south by the mark and a pole fixed (at the point reached by the mark). This is the place of the dakṣināgni. This is according to Śruti.
The east-west line (prācî) has the measure of the sacrificer (96 angulas) or of indefinite measure like that of clarified butter in relation to fire. Such is the case with the breadth. The two amsas (shoulders) of the fire-altar are to be raised in the east and the two śroṇīs (hips) in the west. It (the altar) is shorter on the eastern side, broader on the western side and curved in the middle. It is like a wooden doll. Such is the tradition of the dārśikyā fire-altar.
To the west of the āhavanîya is constructed the four-sided elongated figure of which the length has the measure of the sacrificer (96 angulas). A cord equal to this measure is increased by itself and a mark given at the middle. With the two ties (of the cord) fastened to the (poles at the) south-western and south-eastern corners, it is stretched towards the south by the mark and a pole fixed (at the spot reached by the mark). Fixing both ends of the cord. at this pole, an arc of a circle is drawn from the south-western to the south- eastern corner (with the middle mark of the cord). The same is done on the northern side (of the fire-altar). The western and the eastern sides are to be similarly circumscribed by means of a cord double the (respective) side.

According to tradition, the saumikyā vedi measures 30 padas or prakramas on its western side, 36 (padas or prakramas) along the east-west line and 24 (padas or prakramas) on its eastern side.
To a cord of 36 (padas or prakramas) another piece of 18 (padas or prakramas) is added and a mark is given at a distance of 12 and another mark at a distance of 15 from the western end (of the cord which is added). With

ties at both ends (of the cord) fastened to (poles fixed at) two ends of the cast-west line, the cord is stretched towards the south by the mark at 15 and a pole fixed (at the point reached by the mark). The same is done towards the north. These (two points thus obtained) are the two western corners (śronis) (of the altar). After interchanging the ties at two ends, the cord is stretched (towards the south) by the mark at 15 and a pole is fixed at the mark at 12. The same is done towards the north. These are the two eastern corners (amsas) (of the altar). This is the method of construction with one cord.
The diagonal of a rectangle of sides 3 and 4 is 5. With these (sides) increased by three times themselves, the two eastern corners (of the altar), and with these (sides) increased by four times themselves, the two western corners (are determined).
The diagonal of a rectangle of sides 12 and 5 is 13. With these (sides), the two eastern corners (of the altar) and with these (sides) increased by twice them- selves, the two western corners (are determined).
The diagonal of a rectangle of sides 15 and 8 is 17. With these (sides), the two western corners (of the altar) (are determined). The diagonal of a rectangle of sides 12 and 35 is 37; with these (are fixed) the two eastern corners.
The knowledge of these (squared numbers) makes possible the construction of figures of the sacrificial altars.
The (area of the) mahāvedi is 1000 minus 28 (square) padas. From the south- east corner (a perpendicular) is dropped (on the western side) at a point 12 padas towards the south-western corner (from the east-west line). The (triangular) portion cut-off is placed invertedly on the other side. That makes a rectangle. By this addition (the area) is enumerated.
According to tradition, the sautrāmaṇikī sacrificial altar is one-third of the saumikyā vedi. (To find its dimensions), √ of a prakrama is to be substituted for prakrama (in the values given for the saumikyā). Alternatively, the trans- verse sides will be √3 times 8 and 10 and the east-west line (pṛṣṭhyā) √3 times 12. The (area of the) sautrāmaṇikī sacrificial altar is 324 (square) padas.

According to tradition, the (area of the) altar for the afvamedha sacrifice is double (the area of the saumikî vedi). (Here) √/2 of a prakrama takes the place of a prakrama.
One prakrama equals 2 padas or 3 padas; on account of uncertainty in the meaning of the term (prakrama) one may take such value of prakrama as one may wish. The measure (of pada) may be that of the sacrificer or of the adhvaryu, because one directs the efforts of the other,

According to tradition, the altar for the conventional animal sacrifice (nirudhapasabandha vedi) has the measures of a chariot. There it is said that the western side (of the altar) measures 1 akṣa (104 añgulas), the east-west line 1 iṣā (188 angulas) and the eastern side 1 yuga (86 angulas) or the distance between the two outside holes.
This (is to be constructed) by the methods of one cord already mentioned. Having stretched the cord by the mark at fifteen, the western corners are to be fixed by akṣa (52 angulas) and the eastern corners by yuga (43 angulas).
Now, these (units of chariot measure) are explained. 1 îșâ equals 188 añgulas, 1 akṣa 104 angulas and 1 yuga 36 angulas. These are according to the (Vedic) Caraṇa school and are known as chariot measures.
The western side is 4 aratnis or other measures, the east-west line 6 and the eastern side 3. This (is to be constructed) by the method of one cord already mentioned. Having stretched the cord by the mark at fifteen, the western and the eastern corners are to be fixed by 2 and 11⁄2 (aratnis) (respectively).
According to tradition, the paitṛkī vedi is a square, and has the measure of a sacrificer. This (is to be constructed) by the method of one cord already mentioned. Having stretched the cord by the mark at fifteen, the western and the eastern corners are fixed by half the measure.
According to the tradition of the soma sacrifice, the (side of the) uttara vedi measures 10 padas. This (is to be constructed) by the method of one cord already mentioned. Having stretched the cord by the mark at fifteen, the western and the eastern corners are to be fixed by half the measure.
These are measured by the yuga, pada or ŝamyā measures of the sacrificer.
One may take such value of pada, yuga, aratni and śamyā as one may wish when these (words) are used as units of measure, on account of uncertainty in the meaning of these terms.
In the measurement, the two sides should lie along the east according to tradition.

According to tradition, the sadas (shed) is 9 aratnis wide and 27 aratnis long in the south-north direction; according to some, its length is 18 aratnis. This (is to be constructed) by the method of one cord already mentioned. Having stretched the cord by the mark at 15, the western and the eastern corners are to be fixed by 41⁄2 (aratnis).
According to tradition, the uparavas are each 1 prādeśa long, separated from one another by 1 prādeśa. A square of side equal to 1 aratni is made, poles are fixed at the (four) corners, and a circle of radius equal to half prādeśa is drawn (with each pole at the corner as centre) as per tradition.

According to tradition, the gārhapatya fire has the measure of 1 vyāyāma. It is a square by one tradition and a circle by another.
1
The brick (to be used for the gårhapatya fire) is to measure | vyāyāma (32 angulas) long by ✈ vyāyāma (13 añgulas 24 tilas) wide. There are 21 such bricks (required for each layer). In the first layer, the length (of the brick) is turned towards east, and in the second layer towards north.
For the circular (gārhapatya fire), a circular mound of earth is made and a pole fixed at the middle. (With this pole as centre) a circle is drawn with (a radius equal to) | vyāyāma plus the extra (as per rule 3.2 for transforming a square into a circle). Within it (the circle) a square of the maximum size possible is drawn and divided into 9 parts (squares); each segment of the circle (between the circumference and the square) is to be divided into 3 parts.
In the placement (of bricks), the corners of square (in the first layer) point towards intermediate directions; in the other layer, these corners lie at the centres (of the segments of the first layer). (With these two layers) alternating with each other, as many layers as desired are to be constructed.
· The dhiṣnya fire, according to tradition, has the measure of the wooden vessel (pisilamātra); it is a square by one tradition and a circle by another.
Having made a circular mound of earth, the āgnīdhriya fire is divided into 9 parts and a stone is to be placed. The other (dhiṣṇya fire) is divided into as many parts as prescribed and covered with bricks as they fit.

The tradition has it that he who constructs the fire-altar is certain to be (rich). It is constructed in the likeness of the birds, that is, after their shape, in pursuance of express direction (in the matter).
With the help of a bamboo rod of length (equal to a purușa) as mentioned, 4 (square) purușas are measured out for the body (of the fire-altar) and 1 (square) purușa is measured out for each of the southern wing, the northern wing and the tail. The southern wing is lengthened towards south by 1 aratni and likewise the northern wing towards north. The tail is lengthened towards west by 1 pradeśa or 1 vitasti.
The first agni is one-fold (11⁄2 sq. purușa); the second two-fold (21 sq. purușa); the third three-fold (31⁄2 sq. purușa) and so on; in this way one continues upto hundred-and-one-fold agni (1011 sq. purușa).
But indeed the seven-fold (agni) only is to be constructed (first); (for) the seven-fold is the proper fire-altar. Thereafter, higher altars (are obtained) by increasing the area by one (sq. purusa) successively; this is the tradition.

The one-fold and the following (fire-altars up to the six-fold) do not have wings and tails, but the seven-fold does (have them) according to the injunc- tions of the Śruti.
In the case of eight-fold and higher order fire altars, their differences in area from the seven-fold should be divided in seven and half equal parts and each part added to each purușa (of the original seven-fold altar). This is because the deformation (of the fire-altar) is disallowed in the Śruti.
According to tradition, (the term) to be measured with a puruşa means 'to be measured with a bamboo rod'.
9
Two holes are made (at the ends of) a bamboo rod at a distance equal to the height of the sacrificer with uplifted hands, and a third hole is made at the middle. Having placed the bamboo rod along the east-west line, poles are fixed in the holes from the western extremity; two poles from the western side are then taken off, and a circle is drawn (about the pole in the eastern extremity) with the other end (from the west) towards south-east. The pole is then removed from (the hole in) the eastern extremity and fixed at the western extremity, and a circle is drawn (about the pole in the western extremity) with the other end (from the east) towards south-west. The bamboo rod is taken off and one end of it is fixed to the middle (of the east- west line) with a pole; it is then placed towards the south so as to pass over the point of intersections of the two circles and a pole is fixed in the hole at the other extremity. The bamboo rod is fixed to this (last) pole by its middle hole and laid (east-west) touching the outer edges of the two circles; two poles are fixed through the two extreme holes. This is a square of (side equal to) one purușa.
Going about in this way, four squares each of one (sq.) purușa in the body (ātman) are measured out. One (sq) purușa (is then measured out) for each of the southern wing, the tail and the northern wing. As stated, the southern wing is to be increased towards south by one aratni and so on.
A bamboo rod equal to the diagonal of a square of side one purușa is placed across from (the western end of) the east-west line and another (rod of one purușa) is placed on the east side (from the eastern end). By them (that is, by their meeting point) the south-east corner is fixed. By reversing (the place- ment of the two rods), the south-west corner is fixed. Proceeding as before, the north-east corner is fixed.
As in the case of the uttara vedi, it is measured out with the help of a cord or a bamboo rod.
When the fire-altar having wings and tail is increased to higher folds or reduced, the saptamakarani of the fold (vidha) is to be substituted by the puruşa and the area (of the fire-altar) drawn.TRANSLATION

Of the bricks, the side (of the first type) should measure one-fifth of a purușa ; the second type has one of its sides longer by half; the third type is one-fifth of a purușa long and one prādesa broad; bricks with each side equal to one prādeśa form the fourth type; square bricks of side equal to one-fifteenth (of a purușa) constitute the fifth type.
The height of the brick is to be made a fifth of the jānu and that of the nākasat and pañcacoḍā half of that measure.
What is lost by burning (and drying) is to be made good by loose earth because of the flexibility of its quality.

In the placement (of bricks), 10 bricks longer by half (that is, 36 ang×24 ang) and turned towards west are placed on the east side of the body (ātman); 10 (of them) turned towards east on the west side (of the body); 5 (of them) at each end of the two wings; 5 (of them) at both junctions of the wings (with the body) such that half of the bricks (that is, the added half 12 ang of the adhyardhā) lie in the wings; and 5 bricks turned towards north and south on both sides of the tail.
After placing bricks of side equal to 1 prādeŝa in the tail, all the (remaining) space of the fire-altar is to be covered with bricks of side equal to one-fifth (of a puruşa).
The number (of 200 bricks) is to be completed with bricks of side equal to one-fifteenth (of a purusa).
In the other layer, 10 bricks longer by half and turned towards north are placed on the south side of the body and 10 (of them) turned towards south on the north side (of the body). (The placement of bricks) in the tail will be the same as in the wings for the first layer and that in the wings the same as in the tail (for the first layer). In the junction (between the tail and the body), (the placement of bricks should be) in the reverse order.
The whole (of the remaining) space of the fire-altar is to be covered with bricks of side equal to one-fifth (of a purușa).
The number (of 200 bricks) is to be completed with bricks of side equal to one-fifteenth (of a purușa). (With the two layers) alternating with each other as many layers as desired are to be constructed.
There are five layers; these are covered with five (layers of) loose earth, ending up with a layer of earth; (this is done) for various purposes (served by) loose earth.
10.8 The construction of the fire-altar for the first time should be with 1000 bricks upto (the height of) the knee; for the second time with 2000 bricks upto (the height of) the navel; for the third time with 3000 bricks upto (a height of) the mouth; and so on upto higher and higher heights. Those who

ĀPASTAMBA-ŚULBASÚTRA
desire heaven should construct by increasing the height measure with innumerable bricks; this is the tradition.
10.9 In the case of (fire-altars employing) 2000 bricks, the piles will be two layered; in the case of 3000 bricks, three layered; in the case of 4000 and larger number of bricks, the number of bricks (for the layer) remains the same (as that for the 3000).
10.10 According to tradition, a smaller fire-altar should not be laid after a larger
one has been constructed.
11.1
11.2
11
According to tradition, the fire-altar is to be constructed with four sided (bricks); in the absence of anything mentioned in particular, a square is to be understood.
(The bricks should be) of the measure of pada, aratni, urvasthi and aṇuka; this is the tradition.
11.3 anūka is one-fourth (of a purușa), aratni one-fifth (of a purușa), and so is ūrvasthi
(one-sixth of a purușa).
11.4
11.5
11.6
The quarter bricks have the measure of a păda; there one is free to choose owing to the wide range of the meaning of the word (pada).
In the placement (of bricks), 8 bricks of size quarter of the one-fourth (that is, 15 x 15 sq. ang.) are to be placed at each end of the two wings and 8 similar bricks at the (two) junctures (between the wing and the body) such that 6 angulas (of the bricks) lie within the body. 8 bricks (of the same type) are placed on the western corners (of the body, 4 on each, lined) towards east and 8 bricks on the eastern corner towards west.
In the space (of the body) between the two junctures (with the wings), bricks of size one-fifth (of a purusa) and their quarters (are placed).
11.7 After placing bricks of size equal to 1 prādeśa in the tail, the whole of the
(remaining space of the) fire-altar is to be covered with one-fourth bricks.
11.8 The number (of 200 bricks) is to be completed with quarter bricks.
11.9
In the other layer, one-fifth bricks are placed in the middle of the juncture of the tail (with the body). 14 bricks of size quarter of them (of one-fifth, that is, 12 x 12 sq. ang.) are placed around in the body as they fit.
11.10 The whole of the (remaining) fire-altar is to be covered with one-fifth bricks. 11.11 The number (of 200 bricks) is to be completed with quarter bricks. (With the two layers) alternating with each other as many layers as desired are to be constructed.
12
12.1 For one-fold etc. (upto the six-fold fire-altar), square bricks of side equal to one-twelfth and one-thirteenth of the side (of the fire-altar) are to be made

as also their quarters. (With the two layers) alternating with each other as many layers as desired are to be constructed.
From one-fold etc. (upto the six-fold), bricks are used in the first, second and third construction; in all cases and also for higher constructions, their number is according to the prescription of the Śruti (that is, 1000 bricks for all constructions).
12.3 The kamya (fire-altars) are (endowed with) different merits and (are prescribed for the fulfilment of special desires) according to the science of merits (guṇaśāstra).
12.4 Those who have many foes should construct a (fire-altar in the form of an
isosceles) triangle; this is the tradition.
12.5 A square twice as large as the area of the (seven-fold) fire-altar with (two) aratnis and (one) prādeśa is laid; the mid-point of the eastern side (of the square) is joined to the two western corners (of the square, and the area lying outside these lines is cut off); this is the exact triangle (equal in area to the seven-fold fire-altars of 71⁄2 sq. puruṣa).
12.6 Bricks are to be made as in the case of one-fold etc. fire-altars (that is, of side equal to one-twelfth and one-thirteenth of the side of the altar); these should have the shape of an isosceles triangle.
12.7 According to tradition, those who wish to destroy existing and future enemies should construct a fire-altar in the form of a rhombus (made of two isosceles triangles, ubhayata prauga).
12.8
This (rhombus) looks like two inverted (fore parts) of a cart (joined together). As in the case (of the isosceles triangle), a rectangle (twice the area of 7 sq. purușa) is constructed and the mid-points of the eastern and western sides are joined to the mid-points of the southern and northern sides (of the rectangle, and the area lying outside these lines is cut off); this is the exact rhombus. (Bricks for this fire-altars are to be made in the same manner) as described in the case of the isosceles fire-altars.
12.9 According to tradition, a fire-altar in the form of a chariot wheel is to be
constructed (when it is desired) to destroy enemies.
12.10 A circle of area equal to that of the (seven-fold) fire-altar with (two) aratnis and (one) prādeśa is made and the largest possible square is inscribed in it.
13
13.1
13.2
Bricks (for the construction of the chariot wheel fire-altar) are made with the twelfth part of the side (of the inscribed square).
6 of these (bricks) are placed in each circular segment and the remaining space (of the segment) is divided into 8 parts.

In the placement (of the first layer), the corners of the square should lie in the intermediate directions and in the other layer in the centres of the segments (of the first layer). (With these two layers) alternating with each other, as many layers as desired are to be constructed.
According to tradition, those who desired food should construct a fire-altar in the form of a trough.
The troughs are indeed of two types, e.g. the square-shaped and the circular. One can construct the fire-altar of any one of these (two) types as one may wish.
13.7 Rather from considerations of quality a square (dronacit) should be cons-
tructed.
13.8 According to tradition, the handle (of the trough) should lie on (its) western
side.
13.9 The area of the handle is one-tenth of the total area (of the fire-altar). This being placed in the form of the tail (separate from the body), the area (of the square body) is found by the difference (of two squares) as already stated.
13.10 The (square) bricks are to be made with the twelfth part of the side (of the square body). Bricks longer by half (adhyardhā) and quarter bricks are also made.
13.11 In the placement (of the bricks in the first layer), the bricks longer by half are arranged on the eastern side of the body, turned towards west, at the (west) end of the handle and at the two western corners (of the body).
13.12 The remaining space of the fire-altar is covered with square bricks.
13.13 The number (of 200 bricks) is to be completed with quarter bricks.
13.14 In the other layer, the bricks longer by half are placed along the southern side of the body, turned towards north and along the northern side, turned towards south; the same is done along the southern and the northern side of the handle.
13.15 The remaining space of the fire-altar is covered with square bricks.
13.16 The number (of 200 bricks) is to be completed with quarter bricks. (With these two layers) alternating with each other, as many layers as desired are to be constructed.

Those who desire villages should construct the paricayya (fire-altar); this is the tradition.
The paricayya is that (fire-altar) in which bricks are placed around the central svayamātṛṇṇā (brick).
14.6 According to tradition, the upacayya is to be constructed by those who desire villages. It is prepared in a manner opposite to that of the paricāyya (that is, the construction proceeds from outside to the centre).
14.7
14.8
14.9
Those who desire prosperity in the abode of the Fathers should construct the fire-altar in the form of a pyre (śmaśānacit); this is the tradition.
The pyres are indeed of two types, e.g. the square-shaped and the circular.
One can construct the fire-altar of any one of these (two) types as one may wish.
14.10 Rather from considerations of quality a square (śmaśānacit) should be cons- tructed. In the square type, it should be like the trough without the handle, as already stated.
14.11 According to tradition, those who desire beasts should construct the fire-
altar with the meters (in place of bricks).
14.12 According to one opinion, the entire (sacrificial ceremony) should be per- formed by means of meters, according to another, by the usual sacrificial fires.

Those who desire heaven should construct a fire-altar in the shape of a falcon; this is the tradition.
This (fire-altar) has curved wings and extended tail. The west side (of first half of the wing) is pushed upwards towards east and the east side (of the wing from the middle to the end) is pushed downwards towards west. In this way the wings of birds are said to be bent at their middle (part).
The (area of the) fire-altar is to be made seven-fold with (two) aratnis and (one) prādeśa. (Of the rectilinear syenacit), the prādeśa (portion of the tail) and the fourth part of the body (atman) together with 8 caturbhāgīyās (also from the body) (are to be taken out). Out of these (areas), three (caturbh- āgiyās) form the head (of the falcon) and the remaining (area) is to be distributed between the two wings.
5 aratnis make 1 purușa, 4 aratnis 1 vyāyāma, 24 añgulas 1 aratni and half (of 24 añgulas, that is, 12 añgulas) 1 prādeśa. That is the definition.
15.5
The length of the wing is 9 aratnis and angulas.
114
15.6
ĀPASTAMBA-ŚULBASŪTRA
A tie is made at either end of a cord 2 purușas long and a mark given at the middle (of the cord). Having fastened the ties at the two western corners of the (southern) wing, the cord is stretched towards east by the mark; the same is done on the eastern side (of the wing). This makes the bending (of the wing). Thereby is explained (the bending of) the northern wing.
15.7 The body is 2 purușas long and 11⁄2 purușas broad.
15.8
15.9
At the place of the tail, a rectangle puruşa broad and 1 purușa long towards west is constructed; a similar rectangle is constructed on its southern and northern side. These (latter, i.e. the southern and the northern) two (rectangles) are diagonally cut off such that the length (of the tail) at its juncture (with the body) is purușa.
At the place of the head, a square of side purușa is drawn; the mid-point of its eastern side is joined to the mid-points of the southern and the northern sides (and the parts lying outside these lines are cut off).
16
16.1
16.2
The western and the eastern corners (of the body) are cut off (by lines) in the direction of the junctures (of the body with the tail and the head). This is the (form) of the falcon.
Bricks are made with length equal to one-fifth purușa (24 añg) and breadth one-sixth purușa (20 ang.), the two sides being inclined (with each other) in such a way that these fit (with the shape of the wing). This is the first type.
16.3 Two of these (first type) bricks are joined along the east line (that is, the
length). This is the second type.
16.4
16.5
16.6
That side of the first type, which is one-sixth purușa long is extended by one- eighth of a purușa (15 añg), and (the extended part) is bent so as to fit (with the shape of the fire-altar). This is the third type.
A (square) brick of side one-fourth of a purușa (30 ang) is lengthened by half; the (square) portion of side one-fourth purușa is diagonally cut off. This is the fourth type.
The fifth type of brick is half of the (square) brick of side one-fourth of a purusa.
16.7 By dividing it (the fifth type) by the diagonal, the sixth type (is obtained).
16.8
A rectangle of breadth one-tenth of a purușa (12 ang) and length one-fifth of a purușa (24 añg) in the direction from east to west is drawn. One each such rectangle is placed on its southern and its northern side. These two (latter, that is, the southern and the northern, rectangles) are cut off by diagonals passing through their south-west corners. This is the seventh type.
TRANSLATION
115
16.9 Like-wise another type is formed in which the northern rectangle is cut off by the diagonal passing through the north (-western) corner (the cutting off of the southern rectangle being as before). This is the eighth type.
16.10 The ninth type is obtained by dividing by both diagonals a (square) brick
of side one-fourth of a purușa.
16.11 In the placement (of bricks in the first layer) 60 bricks of the first type turned
towards north, are placed in each wing.
16.12 Along each side of the tail, 8 bricks of the sixth type are placed (in this way); three of them at the end (of the tail) and one above them and again three and one (above them).
16.13 At the juncture of the tail (with the body), 2 bricks of the fourth type partly covering both (the tail and the body) are placed. West of them (are placed) 2 bricks of the fifth class touching each other edge to edge.
17.1
17.2
17.3
17
The remaining space (of the tail) is covered by 10 bricks of the fourth type. 8 bricks of this type, turned towards east and west, are placed in the four corners (of the body).
The remaining space (of the body) is covered by 26 bricks of the fourth, 8 of the sixth and 4 of the fifth type.
In the head 2 bricks of the fourth type partly covering both (the head and the body) are placed and 2 of the same type, turned towards east, above them.
17.4 Thus is formed the (first) layer of 200 bricks.
17.5
17.6
17.7
17.8
In the other layer, 5 bricks of the second type are to be placed at each of the two bendings (of the two wings). At either juncture (of the wing with the body) (5) bricks of the third type are placed in such a way that the portion of each brick extended by one-eighth puruşa lies within the body. The remain- ing space (of each wing) is covered by 45 bricks of the first type, turned towards east.
5 bricks of the seventh type are placed along each of the two sides of the tail. Next to such brick in the second row on one side and in the fourth row on the other side, one brick each of the seventh type is to be placed. The remaining space (of the tail) is to be covered by 13 bricks of the eighth type.
8 bricks of the fourth type, turned towards south and north, are placed in the western and the eastern corners (of the body). The remaining space (of the body) is covered by 20 bricks of the fourth type, 30 bricks of the sixth and 1 brick of the fifth type.
In the head are placed 2 bricks of the fourth type and east of them 4 bricks of the ninth type.

Those who desire heaven should construct a fire-altar in the shape of a falcon; this is the tradition.
18.2 This (fire-altar) has curved wings and extended tail. The west side (of first half of the wing) is pushed upwards towards east and the east side (of the wing from the middle to the end) is pushed downwards towards west. In this way the wings of birds are said to be bent at their middle (part).
120 (square) bricks each of a (square) purușa (side, † pu. or 30 ang) give the area of the seven-fold (fire-altar of 71⁄2 sq. pu.) with (two) aratnis and (one) prādeśa. Of them, 40 (can be accommodated) in the body (ātman), 3 in the head, 15 in the tail, 31 in the southern wing and the same (number) in the northern (wing).

18.5
A rectangle, 11⁄2 purușa broad and 2 purușas long, is constructed. (An area equal to) 2 bricks of th (square purușa) is discarded from each of the two western and the eastern corners, leaving (an area equivalent of) 40 (sodasi) bricks. This is the body.
At the place of the head, a square of side purușa is drawn; the mid-point of its eastern side is joined to the mid-points of the southern and the northern sides (and the parts lying outside these lines are cut off). (An area equivalent of) 3 (ṣoḍaśi) bricks is left. This is the head.

18.6 A rectangle of breadth 1 puruşa and length 2 purusas, further extended by an area of square puruşa makes the southern wing. Likewise (is made) the northern wing.

18.8
At the end of (each) wing, 4 squares of side equal to † of a purușa are made, diagonally divided, and their halves discarded. An area (equivalent of) 31 (ṣoḍaśī) bricks is left.
In the middle of the wing less the end portion (that is purușa or 30 ang with which the 4 squares were made), an east-west line is drawn. From (the western point of) the juncture of the wing (with the body) a cord of length 1 purușa is stretched and a point at the end of 1 purușa is given (where the end of the cord meets the east-west line). At a distance of 1 puruşa from this point towards east another point is given. From these two points lines are to be drawn to the different end points (of the wing at the junction with the body and at the end less puruşa where the 4 squares were made). This is the curving of the (southern) wing. Thus is explained (the curving of) the northern wing.

A brick for use at the end of the wing (pakṣāgrīyā) is bounded by three sides, -one side by purușa, one side by (+7) purușa, and the remaining side by ( √ + 4) purușa.
For making the brick for use in the wing (pakṣeṣṭakā) a rectangle of breadth puruşa and length puruşa is made and then lengthened by a diagonal (so that the other diagonal is shortened and the figure assumes the form of a parallelogram). The slabs are bent by the seventh of the distance between the root (apyaya) and the bending point of the wing (pakṣanamanī).
In the placement (of bricks), 4 quarter bricks are placed in the east of the head, 5 on the western side of the juncture of the head (with the body), 11 on the eastern side of the (eastern) juncture of the wings (with the body), 11 on the western side of the (western) juncture of the wings (with the body), 5 on the eastern side of the juncture of the tail (with the body) and 5 on the west of it, and 15 at the end of the tail.

4 bricks for use at the end of the wing (pakṣāgriyā) are each placed at the end of the two wings and 4 at the juncture of the wing (with the body) each lying partly in both (the wing and the body).
Around these latter (pakṣāgrīyā bricks partly lying) in the body, 4 one- sixteenth bricks are placed on either side as these fit.

The remaining space (of the fire-altar) is to be covered with one-sixteenth bricks; at the (inclined) edges (of the fire-altar) the diagonal sides (of these bricks) are to face outwards; elsewhere. (their placement should be) as in the head.
In the other layer, 2 one-sixteenth bricks with their diagonal sides facing outwards are to be placed in the east of the head; west of them two of these with their diagonal sides facing inwards (are to be placed) partly covering the head and the body.
2 half bricks are to be placed as these fit, and these are to be enclosed by 2 half bricks with their diagonal sides facing outwards.
One-sixteenth bricks with their diagonal sides facing outwards are to be placed where the sides of the body meet (that is, at the western and eastern corners).
4 half bricks (are to be placed) at each end of the two wings. Two wings are (then) to be covered with bricks for use in the wings (pakṣeṣṭakā), (their longer sides) turned towards north.
20.9 3 half bricks (are to be placed) at either side of the tail.
20.10 The remaining space (of the fire-altar) is to be covered with one-sixteenth bricks; at the (inclined) edges (of the fire-altar) the diagonal sides are to face outwards, elsewhere (their placement should be) as in the tail.
20.11 If square or triangular areas arise (due to the removal of ṣoḍaśī bricks for completing the number 200), these are to be covered by half or quarter bricks. Aņukās in the place of pañcadaśabhāgījās (are to be placed).

21.1 The kite-shaped fire-altar (kankacit) and the fire-altar in the form of an alaja
bird are explained after the falcon-shaped (fire-altar).
21.2
21.3
Like the falcon their two wings are larger than the tail and more curved (at the middle); the inclined tail is long (at the end and short where it joins with the body); neither the body nor the head is circular. This is according to the scriptures. Or, in pursuance of the sacred tradition, (the fire-altar may be) without the head.
And it is taught thus: 'One who wishes to live with the head on in this world should provide the kankacit with the head'. Why is it said when one (always) has (the head)?TRANSLATION
119
21.4 Naturally the two wings are curved and the tail is narrowed because such modifications are so heard. Where no (such) modification is heard, the body retains its natural form.
21.5
Thus it is constructed in the form of the falcon, and the shape has been explained after the sacred tradition.
21.6 According to tradition, the fire-altar for the afvamedha (sacrifice) is three
times as large (as the seven-fold with aratni and prādeśa).
21.7
All (sorts of) enlargements are possible in this case as nothing particular is mentioned.
21.8 The enlargement of the wings and the tail is stated to be brought about by
the addition of rectangles.

It is (further) taught that, for the aśvamedha sacrifice, the fire-altar is of twenty-one.

We shall explain (the method of measuring areas by) the combination of the cords.
Having put a pole on a level ground and described a circle round it by means of a cord (fastened to the pole), a pole is fixed on each of the two points where the end of the pole's shadow touches (the two halves of the circle). This (line joining the two points) is the east-west line (prācī). Then after doubling (a given) cord, two loops (made at its two ends) are fixed at the two poles (of the prāci), and (the cord is stretched towards south by its middle point where) a pole is fixed; the same is repeated to the north. This (line joining the two poles) is the north-south line (udīcī).
Two loops are fixed at the two ends of a cord. Marks are (to be given) at the fronis, the amsas, the nirañchana and the samāsabhangas. A pole is fixed at each end of the east-west line (of desired length); likewise (a pole is fixed at each of) the two froņis (west corners) and the two amsas (east corners). Having fixed the loops at the two poles (on the east-west line), the cord is to be stretched by the nirañchana mark towards the south-east corner. The same is done towards the north-east corner. After interchanging (the loops of the cord on the poles), the same is repeated. This is the method (of construction of squares and rectangles) in all cases.
Having doubled (the length of) a given measure, a mark is made at one- fourth of the added length; this is the nirañchana mark. (The length upto the nirañchana is) the diagonal (akṣṇayā) and the remainder the breadth (tiryaňmānī).
Or else, half the measure is added (to the measure) and a mark is made at the sixth part of the added length; this is the nirañchana. (The length up to the nirañchana is) the diagonal and the remainder the breadth.
For (constructing) a square (samacaturaśra), a pole (is to be fixed) at half the measure. For (constructing) a rectangle (dirghacaturaśra), (the pole is to be fixed) at half (of the value) prescribed in the text. The same is for (the construction of) a triangle (śakaṭa-mukha).
By these (methods) are explained the measurements of the sacrificial chamber (prāgvamśa), the altars, as also the other chambers (śālā). In these cases the north-south line (is used in the same manner) as in the east-west line. The same is for the sadas (tent).
By the word aparimita is to be meant a measure greater than the given
measure.

For decrease (nirhāsa) or increase (vṛddhi) as also for addition, the method according to the direction of the text is to be followed.
We shall explain in what follows how to find the southern agni by (the method of) the third. (A cord of a length equal to) the distance between the garhapatya and the āhavaniya is increased by one-sixth or one-seventh (of its length) and the length so increased is divided into three equal parts; the cord is stretched towards the south by the mark given at one-third from the other (western) end; at the point (thus obtained) the fire (is to be placed). The opposite point in the north is the place for the utkara (pit).
1.11 Alternately, with a cord of length equal to the distance (between the āhavaniya and the gārhapatya fire) reduced by one-third, a square is drawn in the eastern half; the fire (dakṣiṇāgni) (is placed) at the śroņi (that is, at the south-western corner of the square). By reversing, the rubbish heap (utkara) (is placed) at the amsa (that is, at the north-east corner).

(The fire-altar is) measured by the units of a chariot expressed in angulas; 188 angulas make one iṣā (pole); 104 angulas make one akṣa (axle of a cart); 86 angulas make one yuga (yoke); and 32 angulas make one famyā.
For (the construction of) the paitṛki (vedi), a square of 2 purusas (in area) is constructed and a pole is fixed at the middle of each side; this is the solution.
(The terms) karaṇī, tatkaraṇī, tiryanmānī, pārśvamānī and akṣṇayā denote cords (measuring the sides of the areas).
The diagonal (of a right triangle) of which the breadth is pada and the length 3 padas is √/10 padas.
Similarly, the diagonal (of a right triangle) of which the breadth is 2 padas and the length 6 padas is √40 padas.
The
juga and the samya measures as seen (in the case of the uttara vedi) have already been stated.
The (area of the) square drawn on the diagonal of a rectangle is equal to the sum of (areas of) the squares drawn separately on its breadth and length; this is the property of plane figures (concerning rectangles).
The diagonal of a square produces a square twice as large (that is, the diagonal equals √2 times the side of the square).
The measure is to be increased by its third and this (third) again by its own fourth less the thirtyfourth part (of that fourth); this is the (the value of) diagonal of a square (whose side is the measure); this is approximate.

2.10 The diagonal (of a rectangle) of which the breadth is the side of a given square (pramāṇa) and the length the side of a square twice as large (dvikaraṇī) equals the side of a square thrice as large (trkaraṇī).
2.11
Thereby is explained the side of a square one-third the area of a given square (tṛtīyakaraṇī). It is the side of a square one-ninth the area of the square thrice as large (tṛkarani). (Alternatively,) the side of three-ninth the square of the original (pramāņa) equals the side of a square one-third the area of a given square (tṛtiyakarani).
2.12 The side of a square one-third the area of a given square (tṛtiyakaraṇī) in
prakrama is used in (the construction of) the sautrāmaṇi (sacrificial altar).
2.13 (By the preceding rules) the combination of squares of equal size is explained. To find a combination of two squares of different measures, a (rectangular) part is cut off from the larger (square) with the side of the smaller; the diagonal of the cut-off (rectangular) part is the side of the combined
square.

If it is desired to remove a square from another, a (rectangular) part is cut off from the larger (square) with the side of the smaller one (to be removed); two poles are fixed on (two ends of) the cut and the line (thus obtained by joining the poles) is placed across so as to touch the opposite side; by this contact (the side) is cut off. With the cut-off (part) the difference (of two squares) is obtained.
(If it is desired) to transform a rectangle into a square (its breadth is taken as the side of a square and this square on the breadth is cut off from the rectangle), the remainder of the rectangle is divided into two (equal parts) and placed in its east and south side; (the empty space in the corner) is filled up by a (small extra) square piece. The removal of it (of the square piece from the square thus formed to get the required square) has been stated.
If (the rectangle be) very long, it should be cut again and again (into squares) making equal (the length to its) breadth; these squares are combined into one square; (to this is) added the (remaining) portion (of the rectangle) after transforming it suitably. This is the method of addition (ekaḥ samāsaḥ).
A square intended to be transformed into a rectangle is cut off by its diagonal (by drawing a line from its north-west corner to south-east corner); one portion (again is subdivided) into two equal parts and are added, one to its east and the other to the north; for a trapezium the side is cut off and added as it fits.
By unit measure the square unit is to be understood. On specific direction, it may be otherwise.
Square on a side of 2 units is 4; on 3 units it is 9 and on 4 units it is 16.

The number of units (in the side of a square) measured by a cord, when multiplied by the same, will give the total number of squares.
Half of the unit will produce its one-fourth, one-third its one-ninth, one- fourth its one-sixteenth.
This is (the method of) deduction (nirhāsa) which has been explained before. This is according to (the injunction) of the śāstra.
3.10 Enlargement (vivṛddhi) and deduction (hrāsa) are made, depending on the
unit of length in a cord (rajjupramāņa).

3.12
If it is desired to transform a square into a circle (a cord of length) half the diagonal (of the square) is stretched from the centre to the east (a part of it lying outside the eastern side of the square); with one-third (of the part lying outside) added to the remainder (of the half diagonal), the (required) circle is drawn. This gives the solution.
If it is desired to transform a circle into a square, its diameter is divided into fifteen parts and two of them are removed. The remaining (thirteen parts) will be the side (of the square).

The altar in the shape of a trough, chariot wheel, falcon, triangle, rhombus and a kind of pot in the shape of a wheel are the (citis of the corresponding) fire-altars.
For construction of trough (droṇacit) a square equal to seven-fold fire-altar together with its wings and tail (i.e., 71⁄2 sq. purușa) is drawn and the tenth part of the area (after being transformed into a square) is joined to the original square like a stalk. This is according to some (teacher). The original square (having an area of 7 sq. puruşa) is to be divided horizontally and vertically by drawing parallel lines from its tenth part; the (ten small squares) are then combined into a square (by the ekasamāsa method) and separated out. The remaining (squares are changed to a similar shape, i.e., a square). (Next) the previous part is to be joined to the latter (towards west like a stalk). The same (process) is adopted in the case of a circular (droṇacit).
In (the case of) an isosceles triangle (prauga) a square whose area is double the area of (the seven-fold) fire-altar with its wings and tail (i.e. 2×71=15 sq. puruşa) (is constructed) and a pole is put in the middle of the eastern side. This pole is then joined (by means of a cord) with poles at south-west and north-west corners. This gives (the construction for) the fire-altar.
In the case of rhombus (ubhayata prauga) a rectangle which has an area twice as much as in the seven-fold fire-altar together with its wings and tail, is con- structed and poles (are fixed) at the middle point of each of its sides. This will give the solution.

(Having desired) to transform an isosceles triangle (prauga) into a square, the former is divided by the prācī line, one (of its parts) is placed on the · opposite side after inverting it, and (the rectangle so formed) is transformed into a square by the (known) method of addition. This is the solution.
(Wishing to transform a rhombus into a square), it (the former) is bisected by its transverse middle line and recombined as before.
By this (method) the transformation of a triangle (into a square) is explained. This also explains the method of (constructing) a pentagon. A pentagon of equal angles is to be cut off into isosceles triangle and that having two types of angles into square.

How one hundred-and-one-fold fire-altar (from the original seven-fold fire- altar) is obtained gradually (by adding one square purușa) will be explained.
Two times, three times of the original fire-altar (which is 7 sq. purușa) is to be constructed always by the method of addition.
Upto twentyone-fold, the fire-altar is to be increased by the addition of one square purușa.
For (the purpose of) adding one (sq.) purușa to the original falcon-shaped fire-altar, a square equal (in area) to (that of) the original fire-altar with its wings and tail (i.e., 71⁄2 sq. purușa) is to be constructed and to it is added one (sq.) puruşa (by the method of samāsa.)
The original fire-altar is to be divided into fifteen equal parts. Two of these parts are to be transformed into a square (by the samāsa method. This will give the (new) unit (pramāņa) of the purușa.
One-fifth (of a purușa) is the measure for the bṛhatī brick and one-tenth (of a purușa) is for the padamātrā.
Or, an area of one square purușa is to be divided (into 25 parts) by (drawing) five lines both ways. Five of these small parts are to be transformed into a square, third part of which is cut off. The remaining (two parts) is added to one square purușa. This is another method (of determining the enlarged square unit).
One-fifteenth of a purușa is 8 añgulas.
5 aratnis, 10 vitastis, 120 añgulas are each equal to one purușa. One pada measures 12 añgulas.
Or, an area of one (sq.) puruşa is to be divided by seven (lines) drawn from both sides; seven (parts) of these are to be combined (into a square); from this combined sum, (a rectangle) of 14 añg. by 1 puruşa (to be transformed into a square) is to be subtracted (by the method of nirhāsa). The
TRANSLATION
125
5.11
remainder (which is a square) is added to one (sq.) purușa. This is another method.
By aratni and vitasti, no enlargement with (purușa) is to be understood; it is a number according to Śruti (i.e. enlargement of puruşa is to be made with its submultiple).

As the (area) of the fire-altar is increased, so is (increased) the unit of the bricks. This we will explain.
The side of a square of area 14 (square) prakramas will give the unit in prakrama for 101-fold fire-altar (construction above twentyone-fold).
Or, in the second and following construction, there should be an increase (of one square) prakrama for every seven constructions.
(At each successive construction), instead of the (original) prakrama the value of the prakrama should be enlarged by its one-seventh.
Such (seventh part increase) is continued upto 101-fold fire-altar.
There should be no increase in the antaḥpatya and the garhapatya agni. The yoni will remain (fixed), for, according to Śruti, (the number of) yoni never increases with the (number of the) birth. Accordingly, the increase of the yoni is prohibited.
The transverse (side) is to measure one less than the number of squares (of equal area) intended to be combined into a square; the two sides (together) should be one more than that; an (isosceles) triangle is to be formed (with the sides and the transverse side as the base); the altitude will produce it (the required square).
The increase of the altar depends on the distance between the poles (yupas). This we are going to explain.
The twentyfourth part of the cord measuring 11 paravān 10 akṣa (1172 ang.) of the chariot measure forms the (required) unit in prakrama.
6.10 Having constructed an altar with this unit (i.e. 1172 añg.), a (rectangular) portion of 12 angulas from the east of the altar is to be cut off, and then having considered the east-west line are placed the poles in the holes (made for this purpose).
6.11
Or, the half (of the holes used for the two end yūpas) at both sides should be inside the altar (and the other half outside). This is according to Śruti.
6.12 According to another (group of teachers), the first and the last pole (yupa)
should be placed inside the altar; this is natural.
6.13 It is an altar having a lock on the crown of the head (śikhaṇḍinī vedi).
MANAVA-SULBASŪTRA

1.1. Now we explain (the measuring with) a cord.
1.2. A cord of correct length with ties (at both of its ends) is stretched properly
along the east-west line (pṛṣṭhyā).
1.3. By the middle of a pair (of nakṣatras) Citra and Svāti, Śravaṇā and Pratiśra- vaņā, Kṛttikā and Pratikṛttikā, Tiṣyā and Punarvasu, having risen 86 angulas (above the horizon), is (fixed) the eastern (cardinal) point, and it is (brought into a line) with the ties (of the cord).
1.4-1.6. (The cord) for the altar of the new and full moon sacrifice (dārśikyā) is 6 aratnis long, each (aratni) having the measure of 24 añgulas. The east-west line, east and west corners (prāci, amsas and śroņis) of the altar are fixed by means of drawing arcs with the help of a cord (marked) at 24 (= 7+17) angulas and 8 ( = 1 + 2 + 5) angulas. The cord is (then) placed from south-east corner (amsa) to the south-western corner (śroņi) and with this distance and with south-western corner as centre, is drawn an arc in the east. Having taken the centre of the circle at south- east corner, an arc is similarly drawn in the west. One end of the cord is now placed at this point of intersection and the portion from the south-east corner to south-west corner is cut off by means of drawing arcs. The same is repeated in the north, east and west.
1.7. The mound (khara) for the eastern fire (āhavaniya) is a square of one aratni, that for the western fire (gārhapatya) is in the shape of a chariot wheel (rathacakrākṛti) and that for the southern fire (dakṣiņāgni) in the form of the half moon (candrārdha).
1.8a,1.8b. A circle is drawn from the middle (point of a square drawn for āhavaniya) with koți measure. With third part of the length which lies outside (the square) together with the original (inside) length (i.e., half of the side of the square) is described another circle (for gārhapatya). Draw another circle with the half of the square circumscribing (second circle). The half of this circle is it (dakṣiṇāgni).
1.9. After having taken a cord equal to the distance between the gārhapatya and the āhavaniya, a mark is made at the third part of the other (i.e. western) end (and another at one-third distance from the east end). One-fourth of the middle part is left out (from the mark at the east). Now the terminal knots of the cord are fixed on (the two poles put on) the (two given marks) and the two cut ends are stretched towards south thereby assigning the (place for) the dakṣināgni.
TRANSLATION
127
1.10. Having interchanged (the end-knots), the place of the northern pit (utkara)
is fixed.
1.11. An extra length of a piece of cord is taken as long as its (original) measure. On the middle of the increased cord is given a sign for fixing the pole, and on the increased piece of the cord within this sign, a nirañchana mark is given at the middle
1.12. By this, the method of construction of all types of squares has been explained.

2.1. The pole (îṣā) is 188 añgulas long, the axle (akṣa) is 104 añgulas, the yuke (yuga)
is 86 angulas; this is the measure of the chariot of the Carakas.
2.2. After a mark is given at 188 añgulas, two marks are given at 6 and 9 and a tie
is made at 43, the measures being in angulas.
2.3. By this the altar for fastening animals (paśubandha vedi) for worshipping Indra and Agni is explained. This is measured with ratha units of the Carakas. The other paŝubandha sacrifice has (a prāci of) 6 aratnis.
2.4. The (mark at) six aratnis is for prăci, at half an aratni is for nirañchana, then at half an aratni for froņi, and then at half an aratni the mark is for amsas. This is the measure of the pāśuki vedi.
2.5. From (one end of) the tie marks are given at 1/2 aratni for south-west corner, then at 2 aratnis for fixing it on the western point of the east-west line, then at 2 aratnis for north-west corner, then at 11 aratni the nirañchana, then at aratni (the mark) for the south-east corner, then at 1 aratnis for north-east corner, then at 1 aratni for the (eastern) tie. The māruti and varuṇa altars are constructed with this cord.
2.6. The whole cord is 10 aratnis long, the nirañchana mark being at its middle. The mark for prāci must be at 5 aratnis. This is used to construct a pointed paityki vedi.
2.7. The whole cord is 7 aratnis; the nirañchana mark is at its middle. The mark for
prāci is at 5 aratnis. This gives the pointed paitṛki vedi.

3.1-3.3. The sacrificial hut (prāgvamsa) occupies (on the ground a square area of
side) 10 (aratnis); the hut for the wife (patniśālā) (a square) of 4 aratnis; the end of the (maha) vedi is at a distance of 3 (prakramas) from the prāgvaṁsa; and the sadas is one prakrama away from the western end of the (mahā) vedi. The (praci of) sadas is 9 (prakramas). The havirdhāna (a square) of 12 prakramas is 4 prakramas from the sadas and 10% prakramas from the yupavaṭa. One pada is allowed for the yūpāvaṭa, and
128
MĀNAVA-ŚULBASŪTRA
the remaining belongs to the uttara vedi. The agnidhra hut is (a square of) 6 aratnis. The cord (required for this) measures 36 prakramas.
3.4. Marks are given on a cord of length 36 (prakramas). The marks for (mahā) vedis, sadas, havirdhāna are given (on the cords) at 15, 21, 3, 3 and then 12. At the soma sacrifice, the best construction is done with (a measuring) cord.
3.5. Where the length of a rectangle is 3 padas, and breadth 1 pada, its diagonal
(squarred) will be 10 padas measured with a cord.
3.6. From a knot (at the end of a cord) used for the construction of the sadas, another knot is made at a distance of 13 (aratni); the same technique is applied for (shorter) length of 9 (aratni); this gives the best division for sadas.
3.7. Take a cord of 10 akṣa and 11 padas; the 24th part of this measure is stated to
be also the measure for the ekādaŝini altar.
3.8. Wishing to construct the sikhaṇḍini (vedi), 21⁄2 (angulas) should be left from the end of the mahāvedi; 71⁄2 angulas are known to belong to devyavedi. From the east this vedi looks like a lock on the crown of the head (sikhaṇḍinī vedi).
3.9. Five and seven (prakramas) and then one and one (less); this is called kaukili
vedi, according to Caraka.
4
4.1. If the sacrificer be short by birth or through illness, what measures should be
used by the priests ?
4.2. Six tuṇḍas made from the upper cover of a lotus stalk make one bāla of a three-
year-old calf.
4.3. Three bālas of a three-year-old calf are equal to half of a mustard seed; two
mustard seeds equal one yava.
4.4a, 4.4b. 1 añgula 6 yavas placed side by side; 1 prādeśa = 10 añgulas; 1 vitasti =
12 angulas; 1 aratni = 2 vitastis; 1 vyāyāma = 4 saya (aratni).
4.5. A man (puruşa) measures 120 angulas according to his own limbs; but standing
on his toes, he measures 125 añgulas.
4.6. 1 kṛṣṇala = 3 yavas; 1 māna = 3 kṛṣṇalas (berry); I nişka = 1 mānas.
4.7. Altars are constructed with (square) bricks having sides one-third (40 angulas) and one-fifth (24 añgulas) of a purușa. The half-bricks are prepared for fire- altars of three layers.
4.8. The (first) layer has eight by eight bricks, the second has eight by eleven; the layer should be placed alternately; the final layer has eight by twelve.
5
5.1. Now we shall explain the bricks required in future (construction).TRANSLATION
129
5.2. A bamboo rod equal to the length of the sacrificer with uplifted arms (120 ang)
is measured out.
5.3. A second (bamboo rod) equal to 144 ang. is taken up, and marks are given at 120 ang. (one purușa), 144 ang. (increased aratni), 132 ang (increased vitasti) and at the middle of 120 ang. (purușa) in each bamboo rod.
5.4. After clearing at the head, poles are fixed at each of the marks at two purușas
and at their middle as in the case of a pañcāngi cord.
5.5. Two bamboo rods are then fixed at the middle poles and a sign is given at a
distance of one purușa towards south, where these (rods) intersect each other.
5.6. A bamboo rod is fixed at the centre pole and held over the sign towards south;
then a pole is fixed at a distance of one purușa.
5.7. The second bamboo rod is fixed at the eastern pole (on the head) and held towards south from east; poles are fixed at the distance of one purușa and also at their middle; the same is repeated in the west.
5.8. By this the northern half is (also) explained.
5.9. At the middle poles on the southern side of the square (thus formed), two bamboo rods are fixed and held towards south, and a sign is given at a dis- tance of one puruşa, where these (rods) intersect each other.
5.10. A bamboo rod is then fixed at the centre pole (on the southern side of the square) and held over the sign towards south; then a pole is fixed at a distance of 144 ang.
5.11. The bamboo rod measuring 144 ang. is then fixed at the middle pole on the eastern (half of the southern side of this square) and held towards south, and a mark is given at a distance of 144 ang.; therefrom towards west a pole is fixed at (a distance of) 60 ang. Likewise, (from the middle pole) on the west.
5.12. (In the same manner) the construction of the northern wing is explained.
5.13. For (the construction of) the tail, vitasti should be used in place of aratni
(that is, marks should be given at a distance of 132 ang.).
5.14. The head lying eastward of the eastern side is to be measured by half purușa
of the pañcangi rod.
6
6.1. For the garhapatya fire-altar, the bricks should be constructed with sides o ne-eighth of a vyāyāma and one-fourth of a vyāyāma (i.e., 12 añgulas × 24 angulas) and with both sides one-fourth of a vyāyāma (24 angulas × 24 añgulas).
6.2. The first type of square bricks is to be made with each side one-tenth of a purușa (i.e., 12 añgulas × 12 angulas); the second type (rectangular) with sides one-tenth of a purușa and one-half of (this tenth) purușa (i.e., 12 angulas × 6
130
MĀNAVA-ŚULBASŪTRA
angulas); the third type (rectangular) with sides one-tenth of a puruşa and one-tenth increased by its half (i.e., 12 angulas x 18 angulas); and the fourth type (square) with both sides one-fourth of a purusa (30 añgulas × 30 angulas).
6.3. Their height is one-fifth of thirty angulas (i.e., 6 añgulas); but the height of
nākasat, cūḍā (fire baked), and ṛtavyā (seasonal) bricks, used in the middle (layers), and of vaiśvadevi bricks used in fifth and sixth layer, is half (of the former set of bricks).
6.4. Loose earth is placed in the space between bricks so that these are
bound together and not separated.
6.5. These materials are placed in the holes for the (grouping of) bricks.
6.6. The verse runs thus: "The pits are dug for keeping the vessels, the heads of
animals, tortoise, wooden mortar, two wooden spoons, pitcher and bricks, and for walking (of person in attendance).'
6.7. (The bricks) are to be placed in all directions within the body, at the juncture of head, tail and two wings, facing towards east, north, east to west, south to north and dividing them equally; depending on the contents, four bricks are to be placed towards cast and five towards west of the seasonal bricks and half (of these bricks) towards north-eastern side of the garhapatya fire. The rest (of the fire-altar) is covered with square bricks (12 angulas × 12 añgulas).
6.8. The same method from south to north is followed in the second layer, the
remaining area being covered with square bricks.
6.9. What is done in the first layer is repeated in the third and the fifth, and the arrangement in the second layer is repeated in the fourth; alternate layers (of the fire-altar) are laid in accordance with these directions.
6.10. Then in the (case of) āgnidhriya and (similar) other constructions, the area should be divided into nine equal parts. In the āgnidhriya, a stone is placed in the middle; in the hotriya, (middle portion of) each side is covered with four turiya bricks (30 angulas × 30 añgulas); in the brāhmaṇācchamsa (hearth), four half bricks are placed in the corners; in other types of fires such as the mārjāliya and the pasu-śrapana (the butcher's fire), six adhyardhā bricks (18 añgulas × 12 angulas) in twos with the prāci in the middle, are used.
6.11. Twenty adhyardha bricks (18 angulas × 12 angulas) are placed eastwise in the two amsas, twenty in the two froņis and in the tail, twelve bricks on the eastern side of the two wings, turned towards east and west, and five bricks on both sides of the head; the remaining (area) is filled with square bricks (12 angulas 12 angulas). This is the first layer.
6.12. In the second layer, twenty (adhyardhā bricks: 18 angulas × 12 añgulas), turned in the direction of north-south and south-north, are placed at the śroni- amsa-paksa portion of the fire-altar; eleven on both sides of the tail; and five turned towards east on either side of the head; the remaining (area) should be covered with square bricks (12 angulas × 12 angulas).

6.13. What is done in the first layer is repeated in the third and the fifth, and the arrangement in the second layer is repeated in the fourth; alternate layers. are laid in accordance with these directions.
6.14. In the three-day worship, two (layers) are constructed on the first day and three on the second day (covered with loose earth on the third day); in the six-day worship, one (layer is constructed) each day (covered with loose earth on the sixth day); and in the twelve-day worship, the construction should be made with one layer of bricks and one layer of loose earth on alternate days.
6.15. By following this method, the construction is made throughout the whole year.
6.16. (The bricks are placed) while reciting the mantras at the beginning and then
touched at the end; that is the characteristic of a purușa.

A bundle of darbha grass, a lotus leaf, two idols of gold, a gold brick, a pebble, svayamatṛṇna (brick), dūrvā bricks (with engraving of durvā grass) and rice- gruel, all are placed in the middle; towards east and in the middle of five cornered space are placed svayamātṛṇṇa (bricks); in the middle, north, south, sruca and kumbheṣṭakā bricks; the remaining bricks are placed in the holes to the west side of the svayamātṛṇṇa (bricks); the west like (brick), a brick consecrated with mantras, towards north of the one of the first interspace; a brick connected with their sides and a brick consecrated with mantras towards north; then in the east two seed-pourer (retaḥ sica) bricks; in the southern interspace a ṛtavyā and a dvitiyā brick and in the east at the fourth place the seed-pourer (retaḥ sica); a brick embodying cosmic light (viśvajyoti), a circular (brick), a seasonal (ṛtavyā brick), and dharma, aṣāḍa, kūrma and bṛṣa bricks are placed; and that is the end (of construction) towards east. In the northern interspace towards the south-east are placed svayamātṛṇṇa bricks from the east; to the east the mortar and the pestle; and near the head to the north-east within it is placed one vessel (ukhā).
7.2. To the west (of ukhā) the purușaciti with its head measuring one purușa is cons-
tructed with thirty-six bricks in the west and nine (bricks) on the śroņi.
7.3. So runs the verse: "Three (bricks) are placed on the neck, six on each of the two shoulders, two on each arm, nine on the body, five on each leg in the west, and one on each hand and foot."
7.4. After having equally divided eight apasyā bricks, in each ninth interspace is placed prāṇabhṛt (brick); in the north-eastern interspace first set (of ten); in the south-western second set (of ten); in the south-eastern (the third set); in the north-western (the fourth set); in the second interspace towards south of the svayamātṛṇṇa the fifth set of ten; in the ninth interspace the supersized joined brick like that of the prăṇabhṛt.

placed the first (set of ten); in the north-western (the second); in the south-western (the third); in the north-eastern (the fourth); in the second interspace towards north of the svayamātṛṇna the fifth (set of ten); the vaiśvadevi (bricks) are placed near each quarter towards north-eastern inter- space, towards south and north in the junction of the wings and their two interspaces towards east of the head of the Atharvan.
7.5. The head, two wings and the tail are divided into equal interspaces and then
the first region (for first interspace) is fixed.
:
7.6. In the first interspace on the head, loka bricks are placed side by side; likewise in the fourth interspace of two wings along east and of the tail along north; towards west of the svayamātṛṇṇa are placed bricks which had been previously joined side by side; in the southern interspace are placed vaiśvadevi bricks, and the northern interspace (is filled) with loose earth.
7.7. In a large sacrifice, procedures, as known through sacred texts, are followed with (chanting of) gāyatri and rathantara hymns of praise in the construction of the head.

8.1. In the second layer towards east of the svayamātṛṇṇa are placed ṛtavyā, vāyavyā and apasyā (bricks), in required number, in the first, second and third inter- spaces respectively. In the southern interspace are arranged the sets of three bricks (ṛtavyā, vāyavyā and apasyā) from south to north; (another) sets of two bricks (ṛtavyā and vāyavyā) (are placed) on both sides north of the ninth (interspace); the remaining space is covered with apasyā bricks.
8.2. In the (construction of the) third layer, ten (pranabhṛt) and twelve (bṛhati) bricks are placed on both sides of the ninth interspace; seven square (samici) bricks are arranged in the east, seven in the west and eight half bricks (ardhotsedha) consecrated with mantras on both sides of the svayamātṛṇṇa in the eighth interspace or in the last (uttama) layer.
8.3. In the fourth layer, the first (rtavyā bricks) are placed first on both sides of each of the ninth interspace. From the east to the middle of the northern interspace side by side; in a similar way (are placed) the spṛta (bricks in excess) from the east to the middle of the southern interspace alternately. In the sixth, seventh and eighth (interspaces) are placed seventeen groups each containing a pair (of bricks) and in the south fifteen groups each containing three bricks in the north.
8.4. In the fifth layer, one prāṇabhṛt on each of the (fire) places; chanda and virāja (bricks) in the remaining places, similar to atimātrā bricks in excess in the sixth, seventh and eighth interspaces as many as are required.

9.1. The decrease (in shape) suffered by the bricks due to drying and burning is
made good by further addition so as to restore the original shape.
9.2. The decrease is always by one-thirtieth part of the original; hence the same
is to be added to have the original shape.
9.3. A brick of 150 (sq.) angulas decrease by 6 (sq.) añgulas; the area of the brick
other than this is deformed (or not natural).
9.4. The (gārhapatya) fire-altar measures 9216 (sq.) añgulas; the measure for angula
and vyāyāma is to be determined.
9.5. The area of each hearth (dhiṣṇya) is fixed at 1196 (sq.) añgulas.
9.6. The area of the fire-altar (agniciti) is 111600 (sq.) angulas.
+
9.7. The original or derived area is 71⁄2 (sq. purușas); then area for head being 25
(sq. pada sq. purusa) is added to it.
9.8. The area is also 800 less 1 pada (799 sq. padas); the kṣetravid knows what the area
of the limbs together with that of the head of the altar should be.
9.9. The body is to be made of 400 (sq. padas); each of the two wings of 120 (sq.
padas); the tail of 110 (sq. padas); and the head of 25 (sq. padas).
9.10. Thirty-one, thirty-three and fifty square bricks are placed; half bricks are
considered for non-square places.
9.11. In the placement of hundred bricks, where there is shortage or increase of
area, the intelligent (person) must use broken bricks consecrated with mantras.
9.12. The bricks for the wings, the tail and the head are placed on the square pṛṣthā;
where the space exists, that is vanished.
9.13. The placing (of bricks) for the rathantara, bṛhalloka and gāyatra yājñiya is remem-
bered by heart and done wisely.
9.14. The number of bricks used (in the construction of) yayuşmati is always fixed;
the number of bricks used in each layer (citi) is being discussed; listen.

9.15., 19.15a. There are, according to experts, 186 (bricks) in the and 80 (bricks) in the second; 113 (bricks) in the third; 104 the fourth; and 356 (bricks) in the last layer.
first layer; (bricks) in
9.16. By all these yajuṣmati layers the fire-altar (the agni) is produced; lastly, it is
plastered with loose earth.
9.17. By this, the yaju (smati layers as quoted) are constructed; there are thousand
(bricks) to be laid with (the use of) sands.
9.18. The fire-altar suitably constructed is like a cow that is produced; the sacrificer
milks always (from this) the desires for the yajamāna.
9.19. He who knows sixty Prajapati (lords) as samvatsara goes to the heaven
(brahmaloka), the firmament and the abode of the sun.

10.1a, 10.1b. According to the vaiṣṇava (measure), the geometrician, the calculator, the dictator, and the one who has taken up measuring as profession are always honoured by the śulbavids. The construction (of the altar) is effected by dividing the earth which has been measured by us (since it belongs to us); the best measure for sacrifice is obtained when the construction is done in one's own house.
10.2. The ground should be plane (or level), the sanku straight, and the cord (made of muñja grass) be free from knotch (or be smooth). There shall be no cons- truction in the beginning of the nakṣatra citrā; this is done when the tithi and nakṣatra are in good accord with water (varuṇa).
10.3. The breadth of all (altars) should be towards east; the altar should be made after the body of the yaska; the height of that altar is equal to arva (16 angulas); and the cutting (of the altar) containing five layers should be at the knee (iānu).
10.4. In the second layer are placed half of ṛtavyā, nākasat and pañcacoḍā; the area
for the construction of the altar is 71⁄2 (sq.) purușas.
10.5. The (construction of the) havirdhāna is completed by a container, of the mound by means of pots, of the cātvāla by animals and of the mound with fire by materials of the sacrifice.
10.6. The half circle of area 1 (sq.) aratni is (transformed) into a four-cornered
mound; by following different methods its volume in aratni is found.
10.7. Having drawn a line equal to 24th part of a purușa in the east, another line of equal length is drawn in the west; towards south is drawn sixteen (angulas) and towards north thirty (añgulas).
10.8. The cātvāla is made one prakrama towards east; and the place for immolation is the same as one prakrama; the (area of) the cātvāla is to be increased depen- ding on the increase in the number of animals.

10.9. Multiply the length by the breadth separately and that again by the height;
this always gives the result in cubic measure.
10.10. Multiply the length (of a right-angled triangle) by the (same) length and the breadth by the breadth; the square-root of the sum of these two (results) gives the hypotenuse; this is already known to the scholars.
10.11. (There shall be no construction) with (the use of) fire and water in śravaṇā
and abhijit, bahulā and tiṣya, citrā and svāti.
10.12. The prâci-bhāskara is to be protected in the night; this is found as the east-
west line by means of a ŝaňku set up in a circle.

11.1. If the sacrificer be diseased or short (in height) from birth what should be
the measure to be used by the priests in this case ?
11.2. A thick cord of hair, a mustard seed, and a yava, (each) six times of previous
one; one prādeŝa is to be equal to 12 human angulas.
11.3. Two such (prādeśas) make one aratni; one prakrama is equal to one aratni; that (prakrama) is considered to be two prādeśas for purposes of measure- ments of a fire-altar.
11.4. A measure of four prakramas is always less by 11⁄2 añgulas.
11.5. There are eleven yūpas, four increased with four at each sacrifice.
11.6. In some altars there are two fires with no use of bricks. If the altars
are constructed separately, the fires are so constructed.
11.7. One hundred and twenty añgulas of a man always equal his five aratnis or ten
padas; depending on the man's stature, the measure may be smaller or larger.
11.8. Eighty-six angulas are known to be equal to one puga; one akṣa measures eighteen (angulas) more (i.e., 86 + 18 or 104 angulas); all ratha measures are done as per prescriptions of the texts.
11.9. Now begins the (method of) construction of a circle. Having desired to construct a circle out of a square, the (following) method has been enuncia- ted by the experts; listen to it.
11.10. The line joining the point of intersections of triangles formed in a square (that is, the point of intersection of two diagonals) and the corner (of the square) is stretched towards east; that (which remains inside the square) together with one-third (of the part projecting outside the square) forms the radius of the circle.
11.11. One puruşa (measure) produces a square of one purușa; its diagonal produces (a square of) two purusas; the diagonal of this (second square) produces (a square of) four purușas or two purușas produce a square of four purușas.
136
MANAVA-SULBASUTRA
11.12. One side (of a right-triangle) is two purușás, the other side four puruṣas; two rectangles, each having two such triangles make as quare of sixteen (square) purusas.
11.13. The fifth part of the diameter added to three times the diameter gives the
circumference (of a circle). Not a hair of length is left over.
11.14. Divide the diameter of a circle into ten parts and leave out three parts. The
square drawn with this (as side) and placed within the circle projects outside.
11.15. Divide the square into nine parts by drawing three (parallel) lines from two
sides; drop out the fifth portion (in the centre) and fill it up with loose earth.
11.16. A man measures four aratnis; for construction with sand, the use of half-arm
(i.e., one aratni extra) is also considered.
11.17. The sides (of a right triangle) are made with 3, 4 and 5; those of others are made by multiplying (these numbers) with desired (quantities), as may be required in the (construction of) altars; this has always been prescribed by ancient teachers.
11.18. For round lines (in altar), the measurement of layers are done by a multitude of measures and their changes; the measures are calculated by length and breadth.
11.19. The (unit of).double the measure of length is found from a (newly) constructed square or from a five-joint cord (pañcāngi) or as explained by the ancient teachers.
11.20a. 11.20b. Here is the method of construction with a five-joint cord; with this the measurement of all altars with the exception of kanka and alaja is done; I shall explain the markings (in the joints of such a cord).
11.21. A cord of double the measure, with marks at both ends, is given a mark at the middle, then another mark at one fourth (of the second half) which is nirañchana and then another mark at the middle (of the second half); the distance (from the nirañchana mark to the end of the second half) is equal to breadth; (with this) the required square (is constructed).
11.22. The east-west line (prāci) then becomes equal to the length of the original measure; two ties are given on (the ends of the) (increased) cord, and a pole at the middle.
11.23. After fixing the western end of the cord at the middle (pole) the cord is stretched towards east-south corner by the nirañchana mark and a pole is inserted at the middle (of the second half); the same is repeated towards (south-)west, and in (the north of) the middle; this is done in the vāsuvedi.
11.24. The ties should be lifted up for the measurement of the western corners.
11.25. Draw (straight) lines from amsa and śroni in the direction of each; with amsa and froņi. (as centres) and distance between them (as radius) draw lines
TRANSLATION
137
(such that these intersect); fix poles at the points of intersection; with these (as centres) and with the same radius (as before) draw.curves on both sides.
11.26. When it (the altar) contains bricks, no line should be drawn in the remaining
two sides (east and west).
11.27. At the eastern and western third post the rubbish heap and the southern
fire (dakṣiņāgni) are correctly placed.
11.28. Other parts are drawn from the middle (line) with nine añgulas.
12
12.1. The half measure lessened by its sixth is known as the viseșa. The viŝeșa and
the measure (pramāņa) produce the diagonal of the measure.
12.2. Take the other half of the measure; increase its (measure) by its twenty-fourth part and give at this a sixth knot with a mark, known as nirañchana, (used) for diagonal; the remaining (part) is the transverse side (tiryanmāni). The froni is half-hand away from the knot.
12.3. It has been advised for (obtaining) the āgnidhra.
12.4. That which is the diagonal of (one-fold) fire-altar is, with the original, the diagonal; in this way the twentyone-fold aśvamedha fire-altar is obtained.
12.5. (The length of) I purușa and (the breadth of) √10 puruşa produce an area of
11 (sq. puruṣas).
12.6. The diagonal formed of two sides each having the length of 1 purușa is not smooth (not an integral number). The fire-altar from 1 to 101 fold has been achieved by increasing its side (as discussed in 12.4.).
13
13.1. In right-angled triangle also (vide 12.4.), the hypotenuse of √16 angulas will
give value in prakrama for the sautrāmaṇī sacrifice.
13.2. One-third of a prakrama (i.e., 10 angulas) is for (the construction of) the saumiki, the queen of the serpents (sārparājñiki). This with 3 and other with √3 serve the purpose of the altar previously mentioned.
13.3. In the soma sacrifice, one prakrama equals 14 angulas or it should be measured
with 1200 (sq.) angulas as in the case of the animal sacrifice.
13.4. Give a mark at one-fourth; draw circles with one-sixth, one-ninth, one-seventh
and one-ninth, and in (each of) half side; there shall be no circle (in the west).
13.5. The sāvitṛ and similar altars should be constructed in four days; the aruṇa
(altar) should be made knee-high and filled with water.
138
MĀNAVA-SULBASŪTRA
13.6. The gārhapatya (fire-altar) has two forms e.g., the square and the circle; the square is constructed with a side of one vyāyāma (i.e., 96 angulas) and the circle with a radius of half puruşa (i.e., 60 añgulas).
13.7. The (rectangular) bricks having length one-third of a vyāyāma and breadth one-seventh of a vyāyāma are to be made and (arranged) in the first and in other alternate layers (each) with 21 bricks.
13.8-13.9. Rectangular bricks (used in other layers) are one-third of a purușa long and one-sixth (of a purușa) broad; its breadth of one prathika (20 añgulas) is arranged along the length (of the altar), the breadth and the length of the middle and the remaining layers being equal. The two bricks each of 20 angulas at the two corners equal the length of the brick (i.e., 40 angulas); (by this arrangement) the cleavage (is prevented). Three corner bricks (of each layer) are replaced by six half bricks (to make each layer of 21 bricks).
13.10. (Here have been used) a number of four-sided bricks measuring more than a
prathika by one prathika.
13.11. In the circular (gārhapatya), there are four kinds of bricks measured with the
parts (of a puruşa).
13.12. Four (square) bricks are placed in the middle; two more (such bricks) to the east and west of them; two each on the sides; then one of the bricks looking like half-moon is divided into two half bricks; the remaining circular parts are equally divided; thus 21 bricks (are made).
131.3. Alternate layers are done with bricks facing north.
13.14. Types of bricks used (for fire-altar) together with the chanting of the gāyatra (metre) include one-and-half, quarter, half-quarter and the fifth of a purușa (padyapāda or pañcami).
13.15. Taking a cord two purușas long and four times the original cord, marks are to be given at equal intervals by an expert; this is known to be pañcāngi by the learned.
13.16. From the middle (of the cord) between ties marks are given at (a distance of) one purușa increased by one aratni; this is called the gayatra measure and used for the construction of a square; at the end each wing is increased by the gayatra (24 angulas) measure and the tail by what is left after taking off 108 angulas (from a puruşa).
13.17. When dried and burnt, bricks (usually) lose one-thirtieth (of their size).
13.18. Then after a place is washed with water and sanctified, it is divided into three
or four parts.TRANSLATION

13.19. Adhyardhā bricks (18 angulas × 12 angulas) are placed,-20 on the north and the (southern) amsa of the prācī, 10 in the tail (on çach side), 12 on each side of both wings, and 5 on both sides of the prăci. The number of bricks are 15 on the head, 84 in the two wings, 85 on the body and 30 on the tail. According to some scholars, there are 99 quarter bricks in the tail, 20 each in śroņi and amsa, 10 on each side of the tail and the wings.
13.20. (In the second layer) ten adhyardhā bricks are placed in the head towards east
and north.
13.21. Bricks in the first (layer) are connected together and turned towards east and those of the second are connected by mantras and intended for aśvini.
13.22. The piling of bricks is done by alternating (the above layers) upto the height
of the knee.
13.23. For a small area of (side) 3 padas, the dhiṣnya (fire) of one layer is to be constructed with 4 kinds of bricks; for more layers it is done with mantras concerning the fire-altar.
13.24. There are 4 adhyardhās (18 angulas × 12 añgulas), and the two in the middle
are to be (divided into six parts) (nakula caturbhāga).
13.25. In the āgnidhriya, a stone is placed in the ninth place (i.e., in the middle).
13.26. Then we shall explain the hotriya. The two nakula bricks of pada measure (12 angulas × 12 añgulas) on the two amsas and śroņis are divided into four quarter bricks giving 14 bricks in each of the triangular directions. In each direction there are 8 quarter bricks.
13.27. In the brāhmaṇācchaṛśa, there are 11 bricks in the middle, two sets of quarter
bricks and a nakula brick (12 añgulas × 12 añgulas).
13.28. There are three quarter bricks (12 añgulas × 12 angulas) on each side and two adhyardhā (18 añgulas × 12 angulas) bricks in the middle, in all eight bricks.
13.29. Six adhyardhā bricks (18 angulas × 12 angulas) are placed on the mārjālīya; its amsa is situated in the southern side of the (mahāvedi) for cooking of sacri- ficial flesh. In the west, three bricks of 12 angulas × 36 angulas are placed for washing the vessel with water after the sacrifice is over.
14
14.1. In the syena (fire-altar) there are 371⁄2 parts in the left wing, 4 in the head, 26 in the body, and 15 in the tail. The alajacit has 17 (parts) in the tail, 2 in the head, and the same (number of parts) in the body and the (two) wings (as in the śyena). These are measured by (bricks of side) one-fourth of a puruşa intermingling the joints of the parts.
140
MĀNAVA-ŚULBASŪTRA
14.2. In the kankacit, 8 parts are in the tail, 4 parts in the feet and 7 parts in the head; the body and the two wings have the same (number of parts) as in the Syena.
14.3. In the construction of syena, alaja and kańka (fire-altars), 81 parts are spread out in the tail, 4 parts in the body, 2 parts in the head and 5 parts in each of the wings.
14.4. In the fyena, alaja and kanka (fire-altars), two-cornered, three-cornered and four-cornered (bricks) are used in the tail. The five (bricks used) at the ends of the wings are those obtained by cutting (the original bricks) by the diagonal.
14.5. Two parts are added to the tail in the alaja which is filled up by three- cornered (bricks); three parts are transferred from the tail of the śyena to the head of the kanka, and two parts are again cut off (from it) for each foot of the kanka.
14.6. 12 parts are measured along east, 20 in north; 15 parts for kanka and 131⁄2 for
alaja in the north.
14.7. A cord (for the construction of vakrapakṣa syenacit and others) should have 12 parts or 12 parts; a mark is given at its middle and that for the nirañ- chana at one-fourth (of the second half).
14.8a. 14.8b, Marks are given (in the cord) first at part 4, then at 5; in another
(arrangement), in the middle and at parts 8, 9, 10 and 11.
14.9. Then it is stretched on the prācī (line) and a pole is fixed at (each of the marks at) the middle of the two (end) ties, and at 8 and 4. Fixing the (eastern) tie at (the pole at) 4, the cord is stretched (by the middle) and the nirañchana mark is given at the middle.
14.10. (The cord is) again stretched from the middle pole (after fastening the tie at it) and a mark is given at 4 parts. The cord is similarly stretched on both sides of the pole at 10, marks are given at parts 2 and 4, and then (a place is fixed) in the east at 5 parts. Poles are inserted at four places at equal distances apart.
14.11.14.12. Then the cord is stretched on the east-west line with ties at the pole, at 51 (part); (again) stretching it at the two western poles, two poles are fixed at 7 and 8, and at 4 and 9.
14.13. A tie is fixed at pole 8 (middle pole of the second east-west line), and the cord is stretched by keeping (the end tie) fixed at the pole 8 (middle of the third east-west line), and two poles are fixed at parts (10 and 11 not inserted before).
14.14. (Having) fixed the tie at the first two poles, the cord is stretched by the
pole at 8, (then) a pole at 10 gives the middle of the tail of alaja.
TRANSLATION
141
14.15. A tie given at mark 11, is fixed at the third middle pole and stretched by the mark at 3; again a tie at 2 is stretched by the mark at 10; and poles are inserted at these two marks; the same is done in the northern (wing).
14.16. The mark at 2 is fixed at the northern point of (wing) and is brought to the
south after stretching it into two equal parts.
14.17. A pole is fixed at the fourth part (from eastern amsa point), and the operation is repeated in the opposite manner. For this (purpose), the cord is stretched from the fourth part.
14.18. The pole is to be fixed at 71⁄2 part in the case of the kanka (cit); this is known.
14.19. Having given a tie at mark 3 (of the cord) and fixed it (in the pole at 8
i.e., the middle pole), the cord is stretched by (the mark at) 10, and two poles are fixed at these two marks. The same is done in the northern (wing).
14.20. This is the cord with 12 marks (used for the measurement of area) of the
syena (fire-altar).
14.21. Four kinds of bricks are prepared with one-third and one-fourth (of a purușa). These are one-ninth of the original (40, 40), triangular (30, 30, 30 √2), half-triangular (15 √2, 30, 15 √2) and five-cornered bricks (15 √2, 15√2, 15, 30, 15).
14.22. Two five-cornered and two half-triangular (bricks) are placed on the eastern (side of the head). One each (of these bricks) is placed at the top of each amsa and at the top of each wings in both sides.
14.23. The middle of the body is filled with one-ninth (square) bricks surrounded by triangular bricks; five triangular bricks are placed in the end of (each) wing.
14.24. Two of the triangular bricks are placed oppositely in the joints between the body and the tail, together with (two) five-cornered bricks at each of the west side; in the joints between the head and the body are placed half- triangular bricks, and the head is likewise filled up with these (half- triangular bricks).
14.25. Two half-triangular bricks are placed on the joints of the wings (one at each western corner), two at the junctions of the tail, fifteen at the tip of the tail, and twentyone at the end of each wing.
14.26. The construction of the falcon-shaped fire-altar is thus completed by using cords of shorter and longer units for the measurement of its area and by (the arrangement of) bricks in alternate layers.
14.27. The wing of the alaja (fire-altar) is not bent; such is done in the previous layer; the tail is worked out from the middle with cord used in (the measure- ment of) syena.

14.28. Two poles are fixed on the ninth part from the eastern point; construct a triangular brick (15, 15, 15 √/2), being one-fourth of a square brick (30, 30); this is so in the alaja due to half of its wing being not bent.
15
15.1,15.2. The same as 4.7 and 4.8, being repetition.
15.3. The fire-altar in the form of an isosceles triangle (praugacit) has an area one half of 15 (sq.) purușas. Join the middle (of the eastern side of the rectangle of area 15 sq. purușas and sides 20 aratnis and 19 aratnis) at 10 (aratnis from either end) with the north-western and south-western froni (points) to form a triangle; the bricks are accordingly made.
15.4. In (the fire-altar in the form of) a rhombus (ubhayata prauga), there are 21 squares (each of side 72 angulas); half of it lies opposite to each other; the two amsas and śroņis are cut off so as to form an isosceles triangle on either side (of the common line).
15.5. The samūhya fire-altars are (built) without bricks in the (four) cardinal directions; cātvāla pits are constructed in four sides and are dug for waste products; this has been prescribed.
15.6. A fire-altar in the form of a pyre (śmaśānacit) should be drawn in the form of a circle or a square. In the fire-altar in the form of a trough (dronacit) there is a handle (tsaru) which has an area one-tenth of the original (fire-altar). 15.7. (For the circular droṇacit) a square is drawn within a circ`e as in the case of the gārhapatya altar; it is measured with one-twentieth part (of the square drawn on 72 añgulas); for the varuṇa (altaṛ) it is done with half-part.
15.8. After the area inside and outside (the squares) is measured, it is divided into ten equal parts (by means of ten parallel lines from each side); there should be a triangle in the corner and joints in alternate layers.
15.9. Each brick used in the square has an area one-thirtysecond (3) part of the square (of side 72 angulas) (i.e., 162 sq. angulas); the bricks of one and half times (adhyardha) are also made; these are like the gayatra.
15.10. (For the drona fire-altar) of 1,000 bricks, each brick must have an area of one-fifteenth part of the square (of side 72 angulas); bricks of one and half times (adhyardhā) are also made; then each layer is known to have 200 bricks.
15.11. (In a construction of thousand bricks), there are 250 one-and-half bricks (adhyardhās), 150 square bricks, and out of 1,000, one-hundred (is always used) for wings of each layer.
15.12. Each of the bricks (used in the second and fourth layer) has an area of one- thirtyfirst part of the square (of side 72 angulas); one thousand square bricks are placed altogether.

15.13. The circular (fire-altar in the form of a) chariot wheel (rathacakracit) covers an area of 101 (square) purușas; it has nave, spokes, and empty interspaces between the spokes and the rim accounting for the excess (area).
15.14. (Each of) twentyfour (spokes and interspaces) covers a rectangular space of
length one purușa, and breadth purușa; these cover (a space of) 3 purușas; half of this space is used for spokes (since half of the interspace is left out).
15.15. Now I shall explain the making of the interspace; the side on the rim is 4 purușa (i.e., 34 añgulas roughly); (the length) is ‡ (sq. purușa) (i.e., 92 angulas roughly); it is placed on the nave at an interval of 24th part of a purușa (i.e., 5 angulas); from that 8th part, it will be formed in the shape of an isosceles triangle (prauga).
15.16. The nave is constructed with two bricks; the spokes are made of four, and the felly of three and their parts; the alternate (parts of spokes) are hollow.
15.17. To measure the interspace of the nave, a circle is constructed with one-fourth of the diameter, i.e., with 43 angulas, and that of the rim with 62 angulas.
15.18. The remaining layers are done with reason and right proportion.
15.19. He who follows traditional methods and measurements appeases hell and goes
entirely to a world with makers of ŝulbas.

16.1a. 16.1b. Another type of fire-altar in the form of a chariot-wheel (rathacakra), as explained by Viṣņu, is to be piled up by the performer; it is three times as large and 7 (sq.) purușas are embedded in its circle by the learned.
16.2. An interspace of 3 more (sq.) purușas is left out from the specified area.
16.3. Its rim (becomes equal to) the breadth of spokes, and the diameter of the
circle and bricks used are made by the third part.
16.4a. 16.4b. The nave is drawn with purusa; it has space for grass; the rim is larger than spokes by purușa; it is the dwelling (of Viṣņu); it has the measure of 3241 angulas and a circle is made in the middle with its 20th part.
16.5. The bricks in the first layer of the chariot-wheel (fire-altar) are known to be
344.
16.6. In the second layer, there are 24 more bricks; five-cornered and three-cornered
bricks are (used) in the joints of the rim and spokes.
16.7. The five layers of the chariot-wheel fire-altar are filled up with 1,768 bricks.
The fulbasūtra is concluded.

CHAPTER 1
UNITS OF MEASUREMENTS, CONSTRUCTION OF SQUARES AND RECTANGLES, KNOWLEDGE OF SURD, THEOREM OF SQUARE
ON THE DIAGONAL AND RELATED PROBLEMS.
In the first two chapters Baudhāyana has given a summary of geometrical knowledge and some results of mathematical interest required for the construction of sacrificial altars. How the knowledge was used in connection with the measuring of grounds and placing of different layers of bricks has been discussed in detail in subsequent chapters. This chapter deals specifically with the units of measurements of altars, methods of construction of squares and rectangles, application of surd numbers, and the theorem of square on the diagonal of a rectangle.

Apastamba (Aśl. 6.5, 15.4) has prescribed the same values of Baudhāyana for iṣā, akṣa, yuga, puruṣa, vyāyāma, aratni and prādeśa. These units of Apastamba have been used by both Kâtyāyana (Kśl. 2.1, 5.9) and Mānava (Mśl. 2.1, 4.4). The unit pada has been made equal to 12 angulas by Kātyāyana (Kśl. 5.9). The term vitasti has been used in place of prādeśa by these two latter śulbakāras as well as by Kautilya in his Arthaśāstra”, while its value remains the same. Mānava (Mśl. 4.2- 4.4) has supplied some more units, e. g. 6 tuṇḍa=1 bāla of 3 years old calf; 3 bālas

  The units like angula, pada, prakrama, prādeśa, bāhu, aratni carry a long tradition and have been used earlier in the Samhitas and Brāhmaṇic literature in the same. sense as these have been used in the Šulbasūtras.b
  CONSTRUCTION of Squares and Rectangles
  1.4-1.5. Square. Baudhāyana has described here two methods of construction of squares.
  First Method. Let XY be the given cord and U a mark at its middle (Fig. 1 (a)); EW, the prăci of the figure = XY; O the middle point of EW obtained corresponding to U of XY, where a pole is fixed.

  A circle with O as centre and OE as radius is drawn (Fig. 1(b)). Then EW is a diameter of the circle along east-west line. Two other circles with E and W as centres and EW as radius are separately drawn. The points of intersection of these two circles are denoted by N' and S' The line N'S' fixes the second diameter NS of the circle whose centre is 0. Again fastening the two ties once at E, W, N and S and drawing arcs, the points A, B, C, D are fixed. Then ABCD gives the required square. Second Method. Let XS, the given measure (pramāņa) be a and XY, the in- creased cord, 2a (Fig. 2(a)). S is the mark at the middle of XY; then XS measures the length for prāci.
  T is the nyañcana mark, so that ST-a-la-la. U is another mark at the
  middle of sr.

  For the construction of any geometrical figure intended in the śulbasūtra XY is always stretched along east-west line, known as pārśvamāni, YT along north-south line, known as tiryañmānī, and XT along the diagonal known as akṣṇayārajju. Now it is easy to see how the right-angled triangle XYT has been used for the cons- truction of the square.
  The corners L and K (śroņi points), M and N (amsa points) are fixed with the help of the point T of the triangle XYT [Fig.2(c)]. Then by using the half-cord Ur, the points C, B, D and A are marked such that WC-WB=ED=EA. The figure ABCD gives the required square.
  1.6-1.7. Rectangle and isosceles trapezium. Baudhāyana's method of construction of rectangle with the help of a cord runs as follows:
  Let XT be a piece of cord taken equal to the desired breadth of the rectangle
  [Fig. 3 (a)];

  A, the point designated by the middle mark S, when both ties at X and Y are

  In a similar way, the other corner points, B, C, D, are traced [Fig. 3(b)]. Hence ABCD is the required rectangle.
  In the rule (Bśl. 1.7), Baudhāyana hints at the method of construction of an isosceles trapezium shorter in one side. For this purpose, a mark on the cord accor- ding to desired length is to be given and the rest is similar to that of Bśl. 1.6. 1.8. Square. Baudhāyana describes here another method of construction of a square as follows:
  Let XS be the cord of given measure a [Fig. 4(a)] ;
  Xr=1a3a;
  SY=1a;
  T the nyañcana mark.

SURD NUMBERS
1.9-1.11. Here Baudhayana states that in a square ABCD, AC2=2 AB2 [since AB- BC] or AC=√2 AB, where AC is known as the dvikarani of the measure AB. If AB=a, AC=√Ã a, where a is the measure. The result is sometimes considered byCOMMENTARY
151
scholars as a particular case of the more generalized rule given by Baudhāyana in Bśl. 1.10. But Baudhāyana gave no such hint. On the other hand, he has tried to establish a more generalized result on the basis of this statement. According to him, when the measure of the side of a square is a, its diagonal is √1⁄2 a. Then again the measure of the diagonal of a rectangle having sides a and √Ã a, is √3 a, for a2+ (√Ã a)2= (√3a)2; √3a is known as the trkarani. This result has been extended

THEOREM OF Square on the Diagonal 1.12-1.13. The theorem states that in a rectangle ABCD, AC2-AB2+BC2 (Fig. 7). This is a most general statement and is enunciated first by Baudhāyana. The proposition is stated almost in identical language by Āpastamba (Ãśl. 1.4), Kātyāyana (Kśl. 2.7) and Mănava (Mśl. 10.10). Baudhayana further says that the theorem is easily verified from the following relations:

No proof of this theorem is given by Baudhāyana and other sulba writers, since it is beyond their tradition to do so. Zeuthen, Cantor, Vogt, Cajori and Heath have

BAUDHAYANA-ŚULBASŪTRA
expressed the view that the general statement was possibly the result of an induction from a small number of cases of right-angled triangles having sides in rational numbers known to them. But this is not the actual case. Our discussions on rational rectangles and construction of geometrical figures amply justify that the general character of the theorem was rightly understood by the śulbakāras.

A number of conjectures by Heath, Bürk, Müller, Thibaut, Datta and others as to the way the proof of the theorem could have been arrived at are available. A few of them are discussed in what follows.
(i) According to Heath, the problem of transformation of a square into a rectangle given by Baudhayana in Bśl. 2.3. formed the basis of the proof. For, square ABCD drawn on the diagonal AD of the right-angled triangle AGD is equivalent to four equilateral triangles, while its sides GD and AG produce two each (Fig. 16). This has also established Bürk's hypothesis.b
(ii) The combination of two different squares as described by Baudhāyana in Bśl. 2.1 (Fig. 12) might have laid the foundation of the general statement of the theorem. This is according to Müller.
(iii) Thibaut opined that the śulbakāras were observant of the fact that the square on AD is equivalent to four equal triangles, one of which is equal to half of the square on OA or OD, i.e. the squares on OA and OD together are equi- valent to four equal triangles (Fig. 8). This pattern of arrangement of equilateral triangles are actually found in the first layer of construction with bricks in the vakrapakṣaśyenacit as described by Baudhāyana.
e
(iv) According to Datta, the construction of the paityki vedi established the theorem of square on the diagonal. The altar is mentioned in the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa (XIII.8.1.5) as a square with its corners pointed towards the cardinal directions. It is referred to by Baudhāyana (Bśl. 3.11) and also by Kātyāyana (Kśl.2.2), where the method of its construction in detail has appeared. The square EGWH obtained by joining the middle points of a square ABCD (of area 2 sq. purușas) is the paitṛki vedi and is half (in area) of the original square (Fig. 29). The original square ABCD is a square on its east-west line EW. EW is again the diagonal of the newly formed square EGWH. This is undoubtedly a convincing proof (since EW2=2 EG2).

(v) The knowledge of dvikaraņi, tṛkaraṇī, discussed by Baudhāyana (B§l. 1.9— 1.11,) led in a way to the theorem of square on the diagonal.
(vi) Both Apastamba (Ãśl. 3.7) and Kātyāyana (Kśl. 3.7) gave an ingenious method for calculating the area of a square or rectangle, thereby establishing the theorem of square on the diagonal. According to this method, if there are p units in AB and q units in BC, then the rectangle ABCD has pq square units, which can be obtained by drawing number of parallel lines through p units of AB and q number of parallel lines through 9 points of BC (Fig. 9). This proves directly that AC2 AB2 + BC2.

(vii) Kātyāyana (Kśl. 2.4 and 2.5) has considered a rectangle of breadth 1 pada and length 3 padas, whose diagonal is a 10 fold producer. According to Dattaa, this justifies the statement of the theorem of square on the diagonal, as may be seen from Fig. 10. In the square ABCD, DH = CG — CK — BF = AE 1 pada.

Although such specific constructions and arguments are not supplied as proofs by the sulbakāras, ample evidence is left by them in their details of constructions to believe that the proofs of the theorem of square on the diagonal of a rectangle were known to them.
Pythagorean Theorem in other Culture Areas.
—
The theorem of square on the diagonal of a rectangle is usually known as Pythagorean theorem after the name of Pythagoras (c. 540 B.C.). In fact, the rela- tion 32 +42 52 and some such relations have been used by Pythagoras, but evidence of any general statement regarding this is not yet available. Actual proof was first given by Euclid (c. 300 B.C.). Proclus (c. 460 A.D.), the commentator of Euclid's Elements remarked: "For my part, while I admire those who first observed the truth of the theorem, I marvel more at the writer of the Elements, not only because he made it first by a most lucid demonstration, but because he compelled assent to the still more general theorem by the irrefragable arguments of science in the sixth book." Heath has quoted this with the remark: "It is difficult for us to be more positive than Proclus was".
It is fairly certain that the practical use of the theorem was current in old Babylonian times (c. 1800-1600 B.C.). The evidence for this is found in certain Babylonian cuneiform tablets. No general theorem was found to have been men- tioned. It has been conclusively proved by Neugebauer that Pythagoras derived his "Number theorem of Universe" as well as the so-called Pythagorean theorem from cuneiform tablets.d The Chinese knew of a similar relation which appeared in Chou Pei (4th century B.C.), but it really became well known from the time of its first commentator Chao Chun Chhinge (3rd century A.D.). A proof of the theorem was given by Bhaskara II (1150 A.D.). According to Needham, Bhaskara II's treatment was derived from the Chou Pei. This is not true, for the proof of Bhaskara II and that given in Chou Pei can readily be deduced from a number of constructions described already in the Sulbasūtras.

TRANSFORMATION OF GEOMETRICAL FIGURES
This chapter deals with the method of combination or difference of two separate squares into a square and the transformation of a square into a rectangle, an isosceles trapezium or a circle and vice versa.
CONSTRUCTION of a SQUARE BEING SUM OF, DIFFERENCE BETWEEN, TWO SQUARES 2.1-2.2. These two rules of Baudhāyana give the methods of construction of a square as the sum and difference of two different
squares.
Here three technical terms, hrasiyasaḥ, varṣiyasaḥ and vṛddhram are used. Accord- ing to Kapardisvāmi,a hrasiyasa means the side of the smaller square, varṣiyasa the side of the larger square and vyddhram the rectangular portion (dirghacaturafram).
Method of combination (samāsa).
For the combination of a smaller square EBGF with another square ABCD, this rule of Baudhāyana suggests that the rectangular portion ABGH is cut off by the side of the smaller square whose side is equal to BG. Then AG of this cut-off portion will be the side of the combined square (Fig. 12).

BAUDHÄYANA-ŚULBASŪTRA
To construct a square equal to the difference between a smaller square EBGF and other square ABCD, the rule Bśl. 2.2 suggests that the rectangular portion ABGH is cut off by the side BG of the smaller square. Then the side GH of the cut off portion is allowed to fall on AB, and P is the point where it falls. Here GH GP. Then BP is the side of a square which is equal to the difference of the squares ABCD and EBGF (Fig. 14).

TRANSFORMATION OF A SQUARE into a Rectangle
2.3-2.4. Baudhāyana has given two methods for transformation of a square into a rectangle.
According to the first method, a square is transformed into a rectangle, such that the diagonal of the square equals the longer side of the rectangle. The method is also given by Katyāyana (Kśl. 3.4).

COMMENTARY

The square ABCD is divided by its diagonal AC (Fig. 16). The portion ADC is again divided into two equal halves by GD and each is transferred to occupy the position AEB and BFC. Then AEFC is the required rectangle. For,
sq. ABCD
tr. ABC tr. AGD + tr. GCD = tr. ABC + tr. AEB + tr. BFC

The method is limited in scope, for it only turns a square into a rectangle, the longer side of which is equal to the diagonal of the square.
The second method concerns the transformation of a square into a rectangle of which one side is given. The same rule is also given by Apastamba (Aśl. 3.1). Both Baudhayana and Āpastamba gave no clear exposition of the second half of this sūtra. To substantiate this rule, Thibaut,a considered as an instance a square
of side 5 units and changed it into a rectangle of 3 units by 8 units. Likewise, Bürkb transformed a square of side 6 units into a rectangle of 4 units by 9 units as follows.

The sq. ABCD is broken into a rect. ABEF making its side BE ( 4 units) equal to the desired shorter side of the rectangle, and rectangle OECP (where EC 2 units), together with a square FOPD. The rectangle OECP is transferred to the other side, and GAFH is its new position. Next the smaller square FOPD (2 units X 2 units) is changed into a rectangle (of 1 unit by 4 units) and IGHJ becomes its new position (Fig. 17). Hence BI (6+2+1 9 units) is the length of the new rectangle. Similarly, if we change a square of 7 units into a rectangle of 5 units by 49 (= 7 + 2 + 1) units, we have to construct a rectangle of unit by 5 units from a square of 2 units by 2 units. This is actually no solution to the problem since the transformation of square FOPD to a rectangle IGHJ is again a problem of fundamental nature.
The commentators Dvārakānātha Yajvā and Sundararāja have described a general method as follows: yāvadicchaṇ pārśvamānyau prācyau vardhayiṭvā uttarapūrvām karṇarajjumāyacchet sā dirgha caturaśramadhyasthāyām samacaturaśra tiryanmānyām yatra nipatati tata uttaraṁ hitvā dakṣiṇāṇsam tiryanmānīm kuryāt taddirghacaturaśram bhavati This means: Having increased upto the desired length the two sides (pārŝvamāni)

towards east, the diagonal-cord is stretched towards north-east corner. The (diago- nal) line cuts the breadth (tiryanmāni) of the square lying inside the rectangle; the northern portion is cut off (by drawing a line through this point parallel to prāci); the southern side becomes the breadth (tiryanmāni) of the (desired) rectangle.
In Fig. 18, the sides BA and CD of the square ABCD are increased to E and F respectively, so that each of the sides BE and CF becomes equal to the given length PQ. The diagonal cord CE cuts the side AD at O. Then the northern portion. EBHG is cut off by drawing a line HG passing through O parallel to the prăci line BA. Now GHCF is the required rectangle.

This is a general and perfectly satisfactory method. Both Thibaut and Bürk did not consider this method as that of Baudhāyana on the ground that Baudha- yana himself mentioned this method as anyaśca prakāraḥ, meaning ‘another method'. Baudhāyana's method was to cut off from a given square a rectangle of side smaller than that of the square while Dvārakānātha's method started from the construction of a rectangle of side greater than that of the square. From our discussion it is clear that in the methods suggested by both Baudhāyana and Dvārakānātha, the final result of constructing a rectangle equivalent to a square is the same but their methods of attaining it are different. For this difference, Sundararāja gave the same line of argument as that of Dvārakānātha in transforming a square into a rectan- gle with the remark, ayamatra prakāraḥa meaning, 'this is the method taught here'. To keep a symmetry with the original sūtra of Baudhāyana, Dattab put the method of Dvåārakānātha in the following form.
From the square ABCD, the portion AGHD is cut off, such that AG DH PQ, the side of the required rectangle. The diagonal AH is produced to meet BC (produced) at E. The rectangle ABEF is completed. Then AGKF is the equivalent rectangle (Fig. 19).
For, tr. ABE = tr. AFE, tr. AGH = tr. ADH and tr. HCE = tr. HKE. Hence rectangle GC = rectangle DK.
Now sq. ABCD = rect. AH + rect. GC

TRANSFORMATIon of a Rectangle into a SQUARE
2.5. This is a most general method of transforming a rectangle into a square given by Baudhāyana. The same method is also taught by Āpastamba (Ãśl. 2.7) and Katyāyana (Kśl. 3.2). Baudhāyana's method runs as follows.
Let ABCD be the given rectangle (Fig. 20). The portion ABFE is cut off such that AE = AB = the breadth of the rectangle. The remaining portion EFCD is cut off into two equal halves. One half GHCD is placed on the other side and its new position becomes BKLF. A small square FLMH is fitted at the corner.

Now, rect. ABCD = sq. AKMG — sq. FLMH, which shows that the rectangle ABCD is expressed as the difference of two squares. Since the method of nirhāra has already been taught before by Baudhāyana (BŚl. 2.2), a square equal to the difference of the two squares mentioned above is found by allowing the side KM to fall at P over BH. Then the square on BP will be equal to the difference of two squares, which is equal to the area of the given rectangle.
For, BP2

sq. ABFE + rect. EFHG + rect. DGHC =rect. ABCD.
In the case of a rectangle of very great length, Kātyāyana's (Kśl. 3.3) advice is to cut it again and again by its breadth, combine the pieces by the samāsa method (B§l. 2.1) and finally to achieve the result by applying the nirhāra method (B§l. 2.2). This is clearly no improvement upon the method given by Baudhayana.
TRANSFORMAtion of a SquARE OR RECTANGLE INTO AN ISOSCELES TRAPEZIUM
2.6. By this method a square as well as a rectangle are changed into a trapezium of given side (smaller than the side of the square).
The square ABCD is required to be transformed into an isosceles trapezium AGCE, whose shorter side AE is equal to the given length PQ (Fig. 21). The
160
BAUDHAYANA-SULBASŪTRA
rectangular portion EFCD is divided into two equal halves and the half ECD is shifted to its other side, such the AGB is its new position. Hence AGCE is the required isosceles trapezium.
For, sq. ABCD = rect. ABFE + tr. EFC + tr. ECD

This method of transformation was known earlier in the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa (Sat. Br. 10.2.1.4).
TRANSFORMATION OF A RECTANGLE OR SQUARE INTO A TRIANGLE OR RHOMBUS
2.7-2.8. Baudhāyana has given a method of constructing a triangle or a rhombus whose area is equal to that of a given rectangle. For the construction of a triangle as described in sūtra (Bśl. 2.7), a square is to be constructed whose area will be twice that of the given rectangle. A rectangle twice the area is first constructed and then transformed into a square by the method described in B§l. 2.5. Let ABCD be the transformed square and E the middle point of AD. Join EB, EC. Then EBC is the required triangle whose area is equal to that of the given rectangle (Fig. 22).

Using the above value of 1/2 and π, the area of the transformed circle – 3.9989a2, which is in close agreement with the area of the given square, 4a2.
If we take π = 3 (Bśl. 4.15), area of the circle becomes 3.885a2, which falls far short of the area of the given square. Apastamba made an additional remark on the method of circling a square as sānityā maṇḍalam yāvaddhiyate tāvadāgantu, which makes also the interpretation equally difficult as to whether, the method is exact or inexact one. The commentator Kapardisvāmī has broken up sānityā as sā and anityā concluding that the method is an inexact one. The passage has been interpreted by Karavindasvāmī as follows: "The circle is exactly as large as the square, for as much the circle falls short, so much comes in.'a Thibaut, Bürk and Datta have referred to the same difficulty as to the real sense in which these words were used by Apastamba.b

The same sūtra is also given by Āpastamba (Ãśl. 1.6) and Kâtyāyana (Kśl. 2.9).
In decimal fraction, the above value of √2 = 1.4142156. According to modern calculation, √2 = 1.4142135. Thus it is clear that the ancient Indians attained a remarkable degree of accuracy in calculating an approximate value of √2. The śulbakāras gave methods, for constructing a square equal to the sum of two equal squares, but gave no method of calculating the value of its diagonal.
Thibaut, Rodet, Datta, and others gave possible methods of solution for arri- ving at the value as follows:-
(i) Thibaut's proof.a

Datta's proof is an improvement over that of Thibaut and maintains the method of construction followed in the ŝulba.

For this one of the two squares having side of unit length is divided into three equal parts by lines drawn parallel to one of its sides. Each of these parts forms a rectangular piece of one unit in length and one-third unit in width. Two of these rectangular parts are then joined length-wise to the two adjacent sides of the other unit square. This leaves a square hole at one of the corners of the enlarged unit

Value of √2 in other culture areas.
A small cuneiform tablet (Yale Babylonian collection No. 7289) of the old Babylonian times (c. 1800--1600 B.C.) shows a square with its two diagonals, with three numbers in sexagesimal system inscribed on it. These three numbers are interpreted by Neugebauera as the value of the diagonal, a side and the value of √2 (since d = √2 a). Here √2 is given as 1, 24, 51, 10, which in terms of decimals comes out to be 1.41421,291....

a little more accurate than the Indian value. The Indian value is smaller while the Babylonian value larger than the actual value. Moreover, their first fractional terms are different. The suggestion that the Indian value might have been obtained from a Babylonian source is groundless. As regards Greek sources, many approximations to the value of √Z are known, but not a value of this order of accuracy.
Irrationality of √2.
Baudhāyana, Āpastamba and Kātyāyana gave the value of √/2, as mentioned above, with an additional term viśeșa (approximate). Many scholars expressed doubt whether, by the term viseṣa, the śulbakāras recognized the irrationality of √2. According to Karavindasvāmi," a commentator on the Āpastambaśulbasūtra, the root sis when prefixed by vi denotes in all cases a 'correction in excess'. Dattad has discussed the matter in detail, and the commentator can be relied upon in this interpretation. Looking into the ancient literature of India, we find in the early canonical works of the Jainas many instances of the employment of the term viśeṣa in the same connection as we find in the śulba. A few instances are given here.

(i) The diameter of the circle is 99640 yojanas, the circumference is 315089
and a little over (kiñcid-viśeṣādhika) (Sūrya-prajñapati, sūtra 20).
(ii) The diameter is 100000 yojanas, circumference is 316227 yojanas 3 gavyutis 128 dhanus 13 angulas and a little over (kiñchid-viseṣādhika) (Jambudvipa- prajñapti, sutra 3).
Hence viseșa refers to a small quantity, which is either in excess or in deficit, and cannot be accurately determined. Šulbakāras gave no proof for it, since it was beyond
their tradition.
CHAPTER 3
POSITIONS, RELATIVE DISTANCES AND AREAS OF SACRIFICIAL FIRES AND ALTARS
This and the following four chapters 4-7 deal with the positions, relative distances, and areas of various sacrificial fires and altars as also the types of bricks used in the construction of some of them. For a fuller appreciation of the details of mensuration presented by the sulbakāras in these chapters, a general idea regarding the plan of the sacrificial ground and the various fires and altars mentioned will be helpful. These details have been given at various places of the Brāhmaṇas, parti- cularly of the Yajurveda school. Karavinda, the commentator of the Apastamba-Šulba- sūtra has also made available a good summary.
PLAN OF THE SACRIFICIAL GROUND
The place for worship and performance of the various sacrificial rites is selected where the ground is high, even and firm, inclining towards the east or the north and rising towards the south.a It should be spacious enough for the laying of the sacrificial hall, the mahāvedi and various pits, structures and elements required. After drawing the east-west line in the sacrificial ground, the sacrificial hall, the prācina-vamśa or prāgvamsa, as called by Baudhāyana, Kātyāyana and others, is erected at the western end, lying along, and symmetrically about, the east-west line (Fig. 26). The name is derived from the use of horizontal beams (vamŝa) supported by four corner posts, on which corner beams are fastened to serve as lintels of the eastern and western doors.b In this hall, besides the priests, the members of the family and friends of the person performing the sacrifice can assemble.
Inside this sacrificial hall are set up the gārhapatya fire at the western end, the āhavaniya fire at the eastern, the dakṣiṇāgni on the southern side more towards west and the utkara on the northern side more towards east. In between the āhavaniya

and the gārhapatya fire is placed the dārśapaurṇamāsika altar for the full-moon sacrifice or such other altars as may be required.
The garhapatya is the householder's fire received from his father and transmitted to his descendants. It is a perpetual sacred fire from which other sacrificial fires are lighted. This fire is used by the priests for cooking oblations. The āhavaniya is a consecrated fire taken from the householder's perpetual fire and is also used for cooking oblations. The dakṣiņāgni, also called by the name of anvāhārya-pacana, is used for cooking food. Eggeling says that, at the new-and full-moon sacrifice, the anvāhārya mess of rice, the priest's dakṣiņā, is cooked at this fire. The utkara placed near the north-east side of the sacrificial hall is a rubbish pit dug out in the ground.
East of the prāgvaṛśa and separated by a narrow space, the mahāvedi or the saumiki vedi (the soma altar) is placed symmetrically about the east-west (prācī) line. This is a trapezium measuring 30 units on the western side, 24 on the eastern side and 36 units east-west along the spine. The setting up of the mahāvedi is descri- bed in the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa as follows (Eggeling's translation)b:
"1. From the post which is the largest on the east side (of the hall) he now strides three steps forwards (to the east), and there drives in a peg,—this is the intermediate (peg).
2. From the middle peg he strides fifteen steps to the right, and there drives
   in a peg,-this is the right hip.
3. From the middle peg he strides fifteen steps northwards, and there drives
   in a peg,—this is the left hip.
4. From that middle peg he strides thirty-six steps eastwards, and there drives
   in a peg, this is the fore-part.
5. From the middle peg (in front) he strides twelve steps to the right, and
   there drives in a peg,—this is the right shoulder.
6. From the middle peg he strides twelve steps to the north, and there drives
   in a peg, this is the left shoulder. This is the measure of the altar."
   After the area of the mahāvedi is thus marked out, the sadas tent is erected near the western base of the mahāvedi. The tent is rectangular in area, the longer side lying south-north symmetrically about the east-west line, and is provided with doors on the western and the eastern side. This tent is reserved for the priests to sit

   and conduct various operations:- "And because all the gods sat (sad) in it there- fore it is called sadas—and so do these Brāhmaṇas of every family now sit therein.”a Clearly the tent is divided by the prăci line into two parts. In the middle of it, a post of udumbara wood (Fiscus glomerata) is fixed to the ground.
   Inside the sadas, six dhiṣnya hearths, Dh, are prepared. These are subordinate or side altars, generally a heap of earth covered with sand on each of which a fire is placed. There are actually eight dhiṣnyas, of which two, e.g., the āgnidhra and the mārjālīya are placed outside the sadas as will be seen in what follows. Of these six hearths placed in the tent, five are placed on the northern part parallel to the east side and belong, in order from the south to the (1) Hoty, (2) Brāhmaṇācchamsi, (3) Potr, (4) Neştṛ, and (5) Acchāvāka. The dhiṣṇya hearth belonging to the Maitrā- varuṇa or Praśāstṛ priest is placed on the southern half of the tent near the east side.
   The two other dhisnya hearths, e.g. the āgnidhra, Āg, and the mārjāliya, M, are placed in the middle part of the northern and the southern side respectively of the mahāvedi. Both these hearths are set up under square sheds with four posts erected over them, open on the east side and the side facing the havirdhāna cart-shed in the middle of the altar. The Brāhmaṇa says: "In the north-with regard to the back part of the Soma-carts-he then raises the āgnidhra (shed). One half of it should be inside the altar, and one half outside; or more than one half may be inside the altar and less outside; or the whole of it may be inside the altar... "e Āgnidhra is the sacred fire and is to be thrown up first. The mārjāliya is a heap of earth on which sacrificial vessels are cleansed and is the last to be thrown up.
   In the middle region of the mahāvedi, east of the sadas and in line with the āgnidhra and the mārjāliya, the havirdhāna shed, H, is erected. This is the shed for the Soma-cart used for carrying soma plants to the sacrificial ground. Regarding the derivation of the name, the Brāhmaṇa says: ‘And because Soma is therein-Soma being havis (material for offering) for the gods-therefore it is called Havirdhāna (receptacle of havis)'.d The cart-shed is provided with doors on the eastern and the western side and possibly on the southern and northern sides. Regarding the construction of the cart-shed, Eggeling, following Sayana and Katyayana, explains that, in front of the carts and behind them, beams are driven into the ground, six on each side. The two middle ones, one cubit north and south of the prăci line respectively, forming a gateway on each side. On these two rows of beams other beams are laid, running from south to north, and forming, as it were, the lintels of the gates; the tie beams running west-east rest on them. This frame of timber is to form a square of nine (or ten) cubits. Mats of seed-grass are spread over the tie beams.

   Uparavas are sounding holes dug out in the ground near the havirdhāna. The soma plants are ground over this hole, emitting the sound of the grinding stone, which gave it the name. The exact location of these sounding holes is not clear. The Satapatha Brāhmaṇa says: 'He digs just beneath the fore-part of the shafts of the southern cart.'a Karavinda says that the uparavas are located in the south-west corner of the southern part of the cart-shed,—dakṣiṇahavirdhānasya dakṣiṇaśroṇyāmu- paravāḥ.
   The uttara vedi, UV, is raised near the eastern side of the mahāvedi, with the prāci line passing through its middle. It literally means 'higher or upper altar' and so is likened to the nose of the sacrificer: 'That high altar (uttara vedi) is the nose oft he sacrificer; because they throw it up so as to be higher than the altar, therefore it is called 'high altar'. The altar is built with the earth dug out of the cātvāla pit. This cātvāla pit is dug out at a little distance towards north from the north-east corner of the mahāvedi. The Brāhmaṇa says: "....and from where the northern peg of the front side is, he strides three steps backwards and there marks off the pit (cātvāla).'¢ It is of the same measure as that of the uttara vedi. Karavinda's comments on the cātvāla is as follows: uttarasmādvedyamsādudakprakrame cātvāla uttaravedisammitaḥ. West of the cātvāla is the rubbish heap utkara, U. Eggeling has observed that the exact distance of the cātvāla is left to the discretion of the Adhvaryu priest, provided it is in front of the utkara and a narrow passage is left between them. He also says that the cātvāla pit should be contiguous to the north edge of the large altar, that is, the mahāvedi.
   DISTANCE AND RELATIVE POSITION OF GARHAPATYA, AHAVANIYA, DAKṢIŅĀGNI
   AND UTKARA
   3.1-3.5 According to Baudhayana, the āhavaniya is constructed at a distance of 8 prakramas from the garhapatya fire, when it is made by 4 Brāhmaṇas. The distance is sometimes 11 or 12 prakramas for peoples other than the Brāhmaṇas and followed traditionally from the time of the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa (Śat. Br. I. 7.3. 23-25). For finding the relative positions of garhapatya, āhavaniya and dakṣiṇāgni fires, Baudhāyana has prescribed the following three methods :
   First method.
   Let A,G, and D stand for āhavaniya, gārhapatya and dakṣiņāgni fires. The distance AG is divided into three equal parts, and with each third part, three squares are drawn touching each other; then the north-west corner of the western square, south- east corner of the same square and north-east corner of the eastern square mark the places for gārhapatya, dakṣiṇāgni and āhavaniya fires respectively (Fig. 27). When A and G are interchanged the corresponding position of D i.e. U will denote the place for utkara. Kātyāyana has given a similar method for fixing the positions of A, G, D and U (vide Kśl. 1.11).

DARŚAPAURṆAMĀSIKA VEDI
3.6-3.8. The dārŝapaurṇamāsika vedi is placed towards the west side of the ahavaniya and is in the form of an isosceles trapezium having face equal to 48 angulas, base 64 angulas and altitude 96 angulas.
Here AD: = 48 angulas
BC 64 angulas
and EW 96 angulas.
A cord of length 2 BC is taken and a mark is given at its middle. Two ends of the cord are fixed at the southern poles A and B and is stretched towards south by the middle mark and a pole is fixed at it. Fixing two ends of the cord at this pole an arc is drawn through AB by the middle mark of the cord. Similar arcs are drawn in other sides. This is the vedi (Fig. 28).
This has been referred to in Ã§l. 4.5 and Mśl. 1.4. The vedi has a long tradition and is mentioned in the Taittiriya Samhita (II. 6.4. 2-3) and Taittiriya Brāhmaṇa (III. 2.9. 10).
PASUBANDHA AND UTTARA Vedi
3.9-3.10. The paŝubandha vedi is in the form of an isosceles trapezium whose face equals 8 padas, base 10 padas and altitude 12 padas. Sometimes the vedi is measured by akṣa, iṣā and yuga units of a chariot. The uttara vedi according to Baudhayana is a square pit of side 10 padas.
PAITṚKI VEDI
3.11. The paitṛki vedi is a square altar and its four corners are placed in four cardinal directions viz. east, west, north and south. The side of the paitṛki vedi is one-third of the units in mahāvedi, which is an isosceles trapezium of 972 sq. padas, having its face of 24 padas, base 30 padas and altitude 36 padas. Hence the corres- ponding units in paitṛki vedi are 8, 10, 12 and its area 1 (8 + 10) × 12
108 sq. padas. This justifies Baudhāyana's statement that the paitṛki vedi is one-ninth in area of the mahāvedi.
-
Again, when one-third of the mahāvedi (i.e. sautrāmaṇiki vedi) is turned into a square, its side becomes 18 padas (Bśl. 3.12). Baudhāyana says in this rule that the
side of the paityki vedi is. This is also quite proper, for by the first method the
18
side of the paitṛki vedi equals √108 or
18
Kātyāyana, however, prescribes that in a square ABCD of 2 sq. purusas, the figure obtained by joining the middle poles E, G, W, H, that is the figure EGWH will be the required paitṛki vedi. The area EGWH is undoubtedly a square of 1 sq.
176
BAUDHAYANA-ŚULBASŪTRA
puruşa (Fig. 29). Here again the area varies from that of Baudhayana but agrees with that of Apastamba (Ãśl. 6.7-6.8). Though there is some difference in area, it is, however, a fact that the paitṛki vedi is a square pointing towards the cardinal directions.
SAUTRĀMAŅIKI VEDI
3.12. The rule of Baudhāyana suggests that the Sautrāmaņiki vedi may be a square of 18 padas or an isosceles trapezium whose area is one-third of that of mahā- vedi, having area of 972 sq. padas. Baudhāyana made no explicit mention of how to construct an isosceles trapezium similar to a given isosceles trapezium but with
1 √3
one-third of its area. Āpastamba (Ãśl. 5.8) constructed it with of the units used
in mahāvedi or 8√3 and 10√3 as face and base and 12√3 as altitude. The mahāvedi is an isosceles trapezium having face 24, base 30 and altitude 36 units. Hence
24

the sautrāmaṇikī vedi is an isosceles trapezium of face

This equals one-third the area of a mahāvedi. The same method is also given by Katyāyana (Kśl. 2.11-2.12).

The uparavā is a square of side 12 ang. or a circle of radius 6 ang. drawn within a square of side 24 ang. Two uparavās are generally placed together at a distance of 12 angulas.
The rites and ceremonies in connection with the construction of the above and various other altars are commonly found in the Taittiriya Samhitā and Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa, but any clear mention of their special magnitudes is very rare.
Baudhayana has made categorical mention of spatial magnitudes besides the methods of construction here and there (Bśl. 7.9, Ãśl. 7.2.). Baudhayana has discussed the construction of the mahāvedi in the next rule. Āpastamba has spe- cially treated the dimension, area and construction of mahāvedi (or saumiki vedi) in chapter 5 of his Apastamba-sulbasūtra. The mahāvedi has much older tradition and its method of construction is mentioned in the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa (IX. 2.1.4).
As regards relative distance of other vedis within the mahāvedi it is known from the Baudhāyana sulba that the sadas is at a distance of 1 prakrama (or pada) from the
178
BAUDHAYANA-ŚULBASUTRA
western side of the mahāvedi, and the havirdhāna at a distance of 4 prakramas (or padas) from it, and in the eastern side of the havirdhana, 9 prakramas (or padas) still remain. Hence the relative distance is 1 + 10 (sadas) + 4 + 12 (havirdhāna) + 9 (rest) 36. According to Manava (Msl. 3.1-3.3), this is 1 + 9 (sadas) + 4 + 12 + 10 36. In this connection it is important to note that the altitude of the mahāvedi is 36.
=
USE OF EKĀDASINI IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF MAHAVEDI and Aśvamedha Vedi
4.12-4.14. In ekādasini vedi there are 11 posts arranged in a row, each placed at a distance of 1 akṣa from its immediate next. The diameter of each hole in which the pole is placed is a pada, and a space of 4 ang. is left on both sides of the two end-poles. Hence the space covered equals 10 akṣa + 11 padas + 8 ang. that is,
1213 ang. For the construction of the eastern part (i.e. face) of the mahāvedi with 11 poles, the length of 1213 ang. is divided by 24 to calculate the value of each prakrama. The distance between the two poles is known as prakrama. The length of prakrama varies for enlarged altars. For this reason the length of prakrama in mahāvedi is different from that of aśvamedha vedi. Since the face of the mahāvedi is 24 prakramas, according to Dvårakānātha, one prakrama equals
10x 104 11 x 15 + 4
24
50 ang. 18 tilas (approx.).
According to Kātyāyana (Kśl. 6.8-6.13), it is the 24th part of 11 paravăn, 10 akṣa that is, 48 ang. 28 tilas (Mahidhara). Kâtyāyana has not considered any space left beyond the two-poles. Mahidhara has suggested 1 paravan to be 12 ang.; the pada according to Baudhāyana is 15 ang., while it is 12 ang. in other exts.
pada
Fig. 30.
The east-west line (prāci) of the mahāvedi is likewise constructed with 11 poles. Only a rectangular block of half a pada is cut off from the eastern side of the altar and the end-pole is placed, so that half of the end-pole is to be considered inside the altar and half outside. For construction of east-west line, the extra 8 ang. that is left beyond the end-poles discussed above is not required in this case.
For the construction of the aśvamedha vedi, by the use of 21 poles, the value of each prakrama is taken to be 24th part of 20 akṣa + 21 padas + 8 ang. which is
20 × 104 + 21 × 15 + 8 equal to
= 100 ang 4 tilas (approx.). 24

ENLARGEMENT OF FIRE-ALTAR FROM 71⁄2 SQ. PURUSAS TO 1011 SQ.PURUSAS, HEIGHT OF ALTARS AND THEIR PECULIARITIES
ENLARGED FIRE-ALTAR AND UNITS
5.1-5.6. The fire-altar of the first construction has an area of 71 sq. purușas. This has been discussed in subsequent chapters. The second construction has 8 sq. purusas, and according to Baudhāyana, it is increased by one square puruşa successi- vely from 7 sq. purușas to 1011 sq. purușas. There is a mention of this type of

increment upto 101 sq. purusas in the Satapatha Brāhmaṇaa. When the fire-altar is increased from the original 7 sq. purusas by p square purusas, Baudhāyana says, the increment in each purușa equals the side of a square of 1 +

the enlarged unit equals √1 +
2p
and the area of the enlarged fire-altar

강 (1+주응)
that is, 7+ p. sq. purușas (Bśl. 5.6).
With this length as unit of measure, the altar is constructed in the same manner
2p as in original falcon-shaped altar. For obtaining the portion, Baudhāyana perhaps divided the extra area into 15 equal parts by drawing 15 parallel lines or by drawing 3 parallel lines in one side and 5 parallel lines on the other after p square areas were turned into a square. Then two of these rectangular pieces were combined together with the help of samāsavidi.
13
Both Apastamba (Ãśl. 8.6) and Kātyāyana (Kśl. 5.5) have given the same value of Baudhāyana, which equals the side of a square of (71 + p) sq. purușas (where p 1 sq. puruṣa). Kātyāyana has given the same value of enlarged sq. unit in two other forms as follows:

Moreover, Apastamba has devised a method of joining complete purușas in the body, wings and tail. If the increased area of p purușas be an exact mutiple or sub- multiple of the original agni, i.e. p = q×74, then the new unit comes out to be √l + q. This is known as increment on the whole posts (sarvabhyāsa, Ast. 21.7).
In the enlargement of the falcon-shaped fire-altar (first plan) let s be the enlarged unit in purușa and p the total increment in area. Then in the form of a quadratic equation this can be written as
body+2 wings + tail = 7+ p
or
4s2 + 2 s

The principle of enlargement of agni by increasing the length of the unit of measure was known in the time of the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa.a It has described the construction of the agni of 101 sq. purușa, where 14 or 14 times enlarged unit in purușa is taken up for its construction.b
HEIGHT AND CHARACTERISTICS OF DIFFERENT LAYERS OF ALTAR AND BRICKS
5.7-7.3. In the usual five-layer construction, the height of the altar is 32 ang., height of each layer being 32 ang. (Bśl. 5.7 and 7.2). According to Karavindasvāmī, it is 6 ang. Actually two layers are constructed. Construction of other layers is not required, since the 3rd and the 5th layer are the replica of the 1st and the 4th that of the 2nd. In the placement of bricks in different layers clefts between two layers are avoided. An altar of daily fire like the gārhapatya has 21 bricks in each layer, while a kāmya fire-altar is constructed with 1000 bricks, each layer containing 200 bricks. A fire-altar of 71 sq. purușas is the normal construction. Pañcacoḍā and nākasat bricks have half the thickness of ordinary bricks; hence one pañcacoḍā and one nāksat taken together are considered as one brick (Bśl. 5.17 and 7.2). They are usually on the fifth layer placed at the top. The spoiled or broken bricks or bricks of black colour are not used in the construction ( Bśl. 7.1).
Usually all the fire-altars from 14 sq. purușas (one fold) to 101 sq. purușas (101 fold) are not constructed. In some cases they are constructed without wings and tails. In the construction of fire-altars from 8 to 101 sq. purușas, how the units in sq. purusas are proportionately increased has been discussed. After all these are not normal constructions and are done in the construction for second and third time. In the second and third construction the fire-altar is constructed with more bricks and increased height. As regards its height and the number of bricks to be used in its construction, the Taittiriya Samhitā writes: "He should pile (the fire) of a thousand (bricks) when first piling (it); this world is commensurate with a thousand; verily he conquers this world. He should pile (it) of two thousands, when piling a second time, the atmosphere is commensurate with two thousands; verily he

conquers the atmosphere. He should pile (it) of three thousands, verily he conquers yonder world. Knee-deep should he pile (it) when piling for the first time, verily with the gayatri he mounts this world; naval-deep should he pile it when piling for the second time, verily with the triṣṭubh, he mounts the atmosphere; neck-deep should he pile (it) when piling for the third time, verily with the jagati, he mounts the yonder world".a (Keith's translation).
The fire-altar (Chapter 6) has the characteristics of an animal. The head of the animal lies in the east and its back is compared with the east-west line. The east-west line is the central line of the altar and measurements are given with reference to this central east-west line. The bricks marked for south and north are placed accordingly on the southern and northern side of the altar. Diagrams of circle, a bull, a woman without ears, line, darbha grass are depicted on the bricks for their use for specific purposes. The bricks with different markings and symbols are also mentioned by Mānava in Chapter 7 of his Mānava-śulbasūtra.
CONSTRUCTION OF GARHAPATYA FIRE-ALTAR (SQUARE).
7.4-7.7. Baudhāyana says the garhapatya fire-altar has the form of a square according to one tradition and of a circle according to another. The area is always one sq. vyāyāma. It is constructed with 21 bricks in each layer. For the placing of bricks in the square garhapatya, the following two methods are adopted.
First Method.
One side of the square is divided into 3 parts by drawing 3 parallel lines and the other into 7 parts by drawing 7 parallel lines. These lines divide the square area into 21 rectangles and the bricks are accordingly made. This is for the first layer. For the second layer, the bricks are arranged differently in the square.
Second Method.
Three kinds of square bricks are made with 6th, 4th and 3rd part of a vyāyāma. The first layer is prepared with 9 bricks of the first kind and 12 bricks of the second, and the second layer with 6 bricks of the third kind and 16 bricks of the first.
How the ancient altar builders determined the size of the bricks of different kinds and the number of bricks of each kind required for the construction of each layer is not known. The solution was obtained possibly on the following line.
Empirical Method.
Suppose the sides of the three new types of bricks be p, q, and r th part of a vyāyāma, where p, q, r are rational integers. The minimum number of bricks must be three, since in each layer there are two types of square bricks and no two layers have identical arrangement of bricks.

since, s221 > 42, p 5, q<4
if p<q, q> 5, p < 4
Putting 9 1, 2, 3, 4, the values of p can be determined by trial, considering the value of x to be integral.
CONSTRUCTION OF GARHAPATYA FIRE-ALTAR (CIRCULAR)
7.8. For construction of a circular gārhapatya a square ABCD as large as possi- ble is inscribed within a circle (Fig. 31) Āpastamba has directed that with half a vyāyāma as radius this circle is to be drawn; the end points of two diameters standing at right-angles to each other when joined give the largest possible square (Āsl. 7.5.).
184
BAUDHÃYANA-ŚULBASŪTRA
The square ABCD is then divided into 9 equal parts by 3 parallel lines from one side and 3 from the other side, and each segment is divided into 3 equal parts. Hence the whole circle is divided into 21 parts and the bricks are accordingly made for the first layer.

7.9-7.17. The dhisnya has one layer only. It may be a square or Generally it is covered with sand on which the fire is placed.
a circle.
The agnidhriya may also be a square or a circle. When it is in the form of a square, it is divided into nine small squares, and the central brick is replaced by a piece of stone. The same method is also given by Manava (Mśl. 6.10). When it is circular, a round stone of 8 angulas diameter is placed in the centre of the circle and the remaining area divided into eight equal parts (Fig. 32).
The mārjāliya is divided into 3 equal parts by lines parallel to the north-south line. The eastern and western parts together are divided into 5 parts. No detail is available in the Baudhāyana fulba as to how the eastern or western part is to be divided. The commentator Dvārakānātha gives the idea of dividing the eastern slab into two and western slab into three parts. Mānava has, however, suggested different constructions (Mśl. 6.11). The mārjāliya, when circular, is divided into six equal parts.
The chandaścit is the fire-altar of mantras, not of bricks. The shape of the fire-altar is drawn on the ground and the whole ceremony performed. Instead of placing bricks, the sacrificer only touches the places on which the bricks are to be placed and mutters the same mantras at the appropriate time.

CHAPTER 8
CONSTRUCTION OF A RECTILINEAR ŚYENACIT—FIRST TYPE
8.1.-8.5. Baudhayana, Āpastamba and other ŝulbakāras have considered the construc- tion of two categories of falcon-shaped fire-altars. e.g. (a) the first category in which the body, the wings and the tail are rectilinear (squares and rectangles), and (b) the second category in which the wings are curved, the tail is spread out, and the body and the head have their corners cut off. In the latter case the shape of the altar more closely resembles the falcon.
The sūtra 8.4 is taken from the Taittiriya Samhitā which runs as follows : pañca dakṣiṇāyāṁ śroṇyāmupadadhāti | pañcottarasyāṁ tasmāt paścādvarṣiyān purastāt pravaṇaḥ pasubasto vaya iti dakṣine'msa upadadhāti | vṛṣṇirvaya ityuttare❜msāveva pratidadhāti | vyāghro vaya iti dakṣine pakṣa upadadhāti | simhovaya ityuttare pakṣayoreva vīryam dadhāti | purușo vaya iti madhye tasmāt puruṣaḥ paśunāmadhipatiḥa |
The construction of the fire-altar after the shadow cast on the ground by a flying bird is also given in the same Brāhmaṇa as follows: vayasām vā eṣa pratimayā ciyate yadagniryannyāñcam cinuyātb
In this chapter, a simple rectilinear syenacit is discussed.
8.6-8.7. Bricks. The following four types of square bricks are used for the construction:
2
B1-one-fourth brick B2-one-fifth brick B-one-sixth brick B-one-tenth brick
(caturthi) —30× 30 sq. angulas. (pañcami)—-24 × 24 sq. añgulas. (şaşṭhi) -20 × 20 sq. añgulas. (dasami) -12 x 12 sq. angulas.
8.8-8.10. Measurement of the fire-altar. In this fire-altar, the body (atman) is a square and the two wings and the tail are rectangles. To set up these rectilinear figures of required areas on the ground, one can use either a cord or a bamboo rod and follow the rules of construction of such figures discussed in chapters 1 and 2. For measure- ment with a bomboo rod with a hole at either end and at the middle, Āpastamba has given greater details which are considered in our notes to Ãśl. 9.1-9.3.
The body is a square of 4 sq. pu., that is, of side 2 pu. or 240 ang. At the middle of its southern and northern side, a rectangle each, measuring 144 angulas × 120 angulas, with the longer side drawn south-north, is set up; this will represent the south and the north wing. A rectangle of 132 añgulas × 120 angulas, with the longer side towards east-west, attached to the middle of the western side of the body, is the tail (Fig. 33). The area of the altar is :
1281 [ [
2402 + 2 x 144 x 120 + 132 × 120

8.11-8.13. Placement of bricks in the first layer. Starting with the south wing,4 B2 bricks flanked on either side by 2 B bricks are placed in a row, east-west, at a distance of 40 angulas from the end of the wing (Fig. 33). Dvārakānātha explains purușatṛtiya- velāyām as catvārimŝadangulapramāṇavelāyāmatītāyām. Then 8 B1s are placed in two rows, leaving a space which can be filled exactly by 18 B, bricks. In this way, 34 bricks can be placed in the south wing (evam pakṣe catustrimsadiṣṭakaḥ. The northern wing is covered in the same way starting with the northern end.

In the tail, as per direction of the rule, 8 B1s can be placed, —4 on the eastern and 4 on the western side, 12 B1s-6 on the southern and 6 on the northern side, and 12 B2s in the remaining space in the middle, accounting for 32 bricks (pucche dvātrimśat-D.). Rule 8.12 also directs the filling up of the body with B, bricks, and clearly enough 100 B2s can be accommodated in a square 240 × 240 sq. añgulas (ātmani śatam—D.). The number and types of bricks used in different parts of the fire-altar are shown in Table 1, in agreement with Dvārakānātha's enumeration (caturthyaścaturvimsatiḥ | pañcamyo vimŝatyadhikam satam | sasthyaḥ sattrimsat | dasamyo vimśatiḥ |).
8.14-8.18 Placement of bricks in the second layer. The arrangement of bricks is shown in Fig. 34. After leaving 48 angulas at the end of the southern wing, 3 B ̧s are placed at the western and the eastern side each towards north, and 3 Bås in the middle; the space (that is, two rows, south-north) in between these three rows is filled with 4 B1s.

CHAPTER 10
CONSTRUCTION OF A FIRE-ALTAR IN THE FORM OF A FALCON
WITH CURVED WINGS AND EXTENDED TAIL-FIRST TYPE.
10.1. This type of fire-altar is constructed more in the likeness of a falcon. To achieve this the two wings are to be curved or bent and the tail is to be extended, that is, spread out. The body (ātman) itself should be cut out at its four corners, and there should be a head. The end of each wing is serrated to give it the appearance of being provided with feathers (patra). The laying of this type of firc-altar on the part of those who desire heaven has been greatly emphasized in the Brāhmaṇas. Here are a few excerpts from the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa : “Prajāpati was desirous of going up to the world of heaven ;................ He saw this bird-like body, the fire-altar, and constructed it. He attempted to fly up, without contracting and expanding (the wings), but could not do so. By contracting and expanding (the wings) he did fly up whence even to this day birds can only fly up when they contract their wings and spread their feathers"a. Again, "He contracts (the right wing) inside on both sides by just four finger-breadths, and expands it outside on both sides by four finger- breadths;...... In the same way with regard to the tail, and in the same way in regard to the left wing."b
10.2-10.3. Types of bricks. For building a fire-altar of this shape which is fully described in what follows, rectilinear bricks alone would not do. Bricks of other geometrical shapes are needed, which are first dealt with. In the first type under consideration in this chapter, the following five types have been prescribed (Fig. 37).

  The wings: A rectangle ABCD, of which AB is 150 ang. and BC 180 ang., is formed (Fig. 38 (d)). At the mid-point P of BC a perpendicular PE is drawn towards east so that PE is 90 ang. Then the triangle EBC is cut off and placed on the eastern side AD as the triangle FAD. The area of the figure ABECDF remains the same as the rectangle ABCD. In this way the wing is bent or curved (nirṇāma). That the area is not affected by bending in this way is clearly recognized in the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa: "He then makes the wings crooked, for a bird's wings are crooked.........he thus draws them out by just as much as he draws them in; and thus, indeed, he neither exceeds (its size) nor does he make it too small.""
  For the construction of the plumages, five squares DGK11, L1K1KL2 etc. are drawn with side 30 ang. and intersected by the diagonals DK1, L1K, etc. The outer triangular halves DGK1, L1K1K2 etc. are cut off.
  1 2
  This is the construction of the southern wing; the northern wing is constructed in the same manner. The area of each wing is 32 caturthis and of two wings 65 caturthis or sq. pu.

  The total area of the fire-altar, including the body, the head, the tail and the two wings is (35+4 15+65) or 120 caturthis (or sodasis), that is, 10 =
  7 sq. pu. (atra ātmani sārdhapañcatrimŝaccaturthyaḥ | sirasyardhapañcamāḥ pucche pañcadafa | dasasu patreşu pañca | pakṣayoḥ sastiḥ | evam vimsatyadhikam satam sodasyaḥ | puruşakşetre sodasa sodasyah serate |--D.)
  10.10-10.14. Placement of bricks in the first layer. The placement of bricks is shown in Fig. 39 (a) and (b). Two methods are given for the head; the second method is shown in (b). In each case the number of bricks employed is 14. At the eastern and the western end of the body near the junctions with the head and the tail 5 B ̧s are placed. In the truncated parts, B2s and Bas are placed. Since the head has already been covered, this means placement in the 4 corners of the body, 2 sides of the wing (excluding the western end), eastern and western sides of the curved wings and the feathers at the end. The rest is filled with B1 bricks.

  As pointed out by Thibaut, the bricks specifically mentioned in the sūtras 10.10- 10.12 total 68; the remaining space, as per sūtra 10.13, can be filled with 91 B1 bricks thus giving a total number of 159 bricks which fall short of 200 bricksa.
  The deficit is to be made good by using B2s and B ̧s as necessary. Dvārakānātha explains that there are 12 rows south-north in the tail and the body excluding the head and the wing (sirovarjam pucchena sahātmanyudicyo dvādaśa ritayaḥ). Starting from

At the junction EF between the tail and the body 2 Bgs and 3 B2s are placed and at the end of the tail 15 Bgs. The end of the wing containing the plumages, TJKLMNOPQRST, is divided into 5 sections in each of which 1 B2 and 2 B,s can be placed. The bricks thus mentioned total 58,-centre of the body 8, junction of the tail with body 5, tail end 15, and plumages at two wings 30.

In the truncated areas, bendings of the wings and junctions (other than already mentioned), B2s and B2s are to be placed; as per Fig. 40, these are : B,—28; B,—14, total 42. In area, these 100 bricks are equivalent to 36 caturthis. Since the total area is 120 caturthis, the remaining space can be filled by only 84 B1s, leaving a deficit of 16 bricks. This is met by replacing 16 B1s by 32 B2s. D. proposes to do this in the following manner. In the wings, the body including the head, there are 18 rows west- east starting from the south. In Fig. 40, 9 rows are marked from the south to the central east-west line, there being another such 9 rows in the other half. 6 B1s in the 8th row between the two extreme B2s and 2 B1s west of B2 in the head in the 9th

CHAPTER 11.
CONSTRUCTION OF A FIRE-ALTAR IN THE FORM OF A FALCON WITH CURVED WINGS AND EXTENDED TAIL-SECOND TYPE
11.2-11.3. Measurement of the different parts. We have noticed the use of a new unit of square measure, the caturthi, 30 × 30 sq. angulas in the case of the fyenacit of the first type. Now another unit, the pañcami, 24 × 24 sq. angulas or 1 sq. aratni (a square of side one-fifth of a purusa) is introduced. Clearly, 7 sq. pu. is equivalent
15 × 120 x 120
to
2 × 24 × 24
or 1871 pañcamis, as stated in the rule 11.2. These units are
distributed in the various parts of the fire-altar as follows:
The head
3 pañcamis or sq. aratni.

These given areas must be satisfied in constructing the figures of the various parts as we shall see in the following sūtras.
11.4. Construction of different parts of the falcon. Unlike the falcon of the first type detailed measurements of the various rectangles involved have not been given. However, with the indications given in the rule and the areas in the previous rules, the various parts can be constructed without difficulty.
The body is made out of a rectangle ABCD (Fig. 41(a) ), of which AD=144 angulas or 6 aratnis, AB = 240 angulas or 10 aratnis and the area 60 sq. aratnis. By the cutting of the corners at distances of 2 aratnis (48 angulas), 8 sq. aratnis are removed so that EFGHIJKL measures exactly 52 sq. aratnis.
The head is constructed out of a rectangle 48 × 54 sq. ang. (AE AG ED
24 angulas) such that EFCBG measures 3 sq. aratnis.
DF
The tail is done in the same way as before. Here AD equals 8 aratnis (192 angulas), AB 3 aratnis (72 añgulas) and the area 24 sq. aratnis (Fig. 41 (c) ). AB, AE, FD, DC being equal to 3 aratnis, 9 sq. aratnis are removed, leaving the area of the tail EBCF as 15 sq. aratnis.
For the wing, the rectangle to be taken should have its side AD as 9 aratnis 216 angulas) and AB 6 aratnis (144 ang.); the area is 54 sq. aratnis. The bending (nirṇāma) is made as before, the distance EP being 3 aratnis (72 angulas). For the plumages, 6 rectangles DGK1L1, L1K1K‚L1⁄2 etc. are fitted at the end of the tail,
COMMENTARY
197
diagonally intersected and outer halves rejected. Now, each such rectangle is adhyardhā-pañcami, that is, 36 × 24 sq. angulas or 11⁄2 sq. aratni; the area of 6 of them is 9 sq. aratnis and that of the 6 plumages (patra) after rejection of half is 4 sq. aratnis. The total area of each wing is, therefore, 58 sq. aratnis and that of two wings 117 sq. aratnis.

11.10-11.13. Placement of bricks in the second layer. By placing B, bricks (ubhayi) at the eastern and the western end of the junction line between the wing and the body such that 12 ang. of the base lies in the body and 18 ang. in the wing, the sūtrakāra avoids the overlapping of edges of bricks in the two layers (Fig. 44). This is also the purpose of placing B,s on each side of the head and Bas at the end of the tail flanked at the western corners by Bыs and B10s. For the complete arrangement of bricks, we again follow the commentator who this time divides the tail, the body and the head in 12 rows beginning with the 1st row at the western end of the tail and ending with the the 12th row at the head. In this division the wing with part of the junction lying in the body is separately treated as before.

In his commentary, D. states 9 bricks in the head, 62 in the body, 21 in the tail and 108 in the wings; that is, he includes in the body 20 bricks at the two junctions of the wings with the body and 2 Bs at the junction of the tail with the body. In the number of brick types, there is no discrepancy: asminprastāre ekādaśa pañcamyaḥ | dvādaśa tadardhyāḥ | ekādaśa taṭṭādyāḥ | dve aṣṭamyau | ekavimśatiḥ | ubhayyo'ṣṭau | sapta- ṣaṣṭiradhyardhāḥ | catustriṛśadardhyāḥ | aṣṭāvimśatidirghapādyāḥ | ṣaṭ śūlapādyāḥ |. 
CHAPTER 12 
THE CONSTRUCTION OF A FIRE-ALTAR IN THE FORM OF A KITE (KAŃKACIT) 
12.1-12.6. The kite-shaped fire-altar (kańkacit) is constructed in the same manner as the syenacit. The areas and shapes of the body and the tail are the same as those of the second type of the falcon with curved wings and extended tail. The area of the body is, therefore, 52 pañcamis or sq. aratnis and of the tail 15 pañcamis. The measure of the head is given as 5 pañcamis and that of the two wings 2 × 57 or 114 pañcamis. These areas total 186 pañcamis or sq. aratnis, leaving a deficit of 11⁄2 pañcamis, as the total area of the fire-altar is 1871⁄2 pañcamis (= 71⁄2 sq. pu.) This balance area of 11⁄2 pañcamis, which is nothing but 1 adhyardhāpañcami (24 × 36 sq. ang.) is utilized in making the feet of the bird. The bending of the wing and the plumages are also slightly different from those of the syenacit, 2nd type. The constructions are shown in Fig. 45.

The head is constructed out of a rectangle 48 × 72 sq. ang. of which the two eastern corners are cut off by 24 ang. (Fig. 45 (a)).

Fig. 45. Parts of the kankacit : (a) head, (b) tail, (c) divisions of 1 adhyardhā- 
pañcami, and (d) the wing with plumages. 
The construction of the tail EBCF is already explained under 11.4. ABCD (Fig. 45 (c)) represents the adhyardhāpañcami (24 x 36 sq. ang.), of which the pañcami part ABHG is halved and used as the two legs GILK and JHNM (Fig. 45 (b)). The half pañcami part GHCD (Fig. 45 (c)) is divided into 4 equal triangular parts and used as feet as shown in Fig. 45 (b). 
The wing is made of the rectangle ABCD (Fig. 45 (d)), of which AB=144 ang. (6 aratnis) and AD = 216 ang. (9 aratnis). For the bending, the perpendicular EP at the middle of BC is 108 ang. The plumages are constructed out of 6 half pañcamis (24 × 24 sq. ang.) diagonally intersected. Note that the area of each wing is 54 + 3 
57 pañcamis. 
12.7. Types of bricks. Six types of bricks are prescribed for covering the fire-altar (Fig. 46). These are :

12.8. Placement of bricks in the two layers. The rule simply lays down that the two feet of the kankacit are to be covered by B, and B, bricks and the remaining space is to be filled up by such types as these fit. Further details have been avoided as enough indications as to the manner of covering up such bird-like fire-altars with curved wings and extended tail have been given in the foregoing types. Following these indications, Dvārakānātha has proposed an arrangement for filling up the two successive layers, on which basis the Fig. 47 and Fig. 48 are here presented, after Thibaut.

As the total area of the fire-altar must be 1871 pañcamis or sq. aratnis, 101⁄2 pañcamis are to be removed from the wings. The construction of the wing and the method of removing the excess area are explained in 13.3-13.5, 13.6 (part). 
The area of each wing being 63 pañcamis and 6 plumages, each of half-pañcami, needing an area of 3 pañcamis only by analogy with the kankacit wing, the rectangular area forming the main part of the wing to be bent should measure 60 pañcamis or 6 aratnis × 10 aratnis (144 ang. × 240 añg.). ABCD is such a rectangle of which AB 144 ang. and BC 240 ang. After bending, it assumes the form ABECDF so that EP = IF = 120 ang. IE clearly equals 24 ang. or I aratni. The patras are DK11, LKL2 etc. From the geometry it is clear that I, J, L5 H lie on the same straight line. Hence the direction (rule 13.4) that, by stretching a cord IH, the area IECH west of the southern half of the wing including the patras should be cut off. The

CHAPTER 14 
THE CONSTRUCTION OF A FIRE-ALTAR IN THE FORM OF AN ISOSCELES TRIANGLE (PRAUGACITI) 
14.2. Measurement of the fire-altar and the types of bricks. The area of the fire-altar should be 71 sq. pu. Under rule 2.7, Baudhayana has shown that an isosceles triangle of 71 sq. pu. can be drawn from a square of double this area, that is, 15 sq. pu., by joining the mid-point E of the eastern side AD with two western corner points B and C (Fig. 52). The base BC and each side EB, EC are given by 
BC= √15 pu. 
120 √15 ang. 
464.76 or 464 ang. approx. 
EB == 
EC 
300 √3 ang. 
= 
519.6 or 5191 ang. 
D. therefore explains that a square with 4642 ang. (= 465 ang) is to be first drawn and the required isosceles triangle constructed, as already stated, in the following terms: tasyā dvikaraṇī pādonapañcaṣaṣṭicatuḥśatāngulā (4643 ang) dvistāva- tyāścaturaśrakṛtāyāḥ pañcadaśapuruṣāyā bhūmeḥ karaņi | evam caturaśrīkṛtāyāḥ pūrvasyāḥ karaṇyā madhyācchroṇi pratyālikhet | tatra karṇarūpayoḥ pramāṇamardhonavimś ati- pañcaśatāngulayaḥ (5191 ang.) | tasya praugasyāparasyāḥ karaṇyāḥ pādonapañcaṣaşṭic atu- ḥśatāṁgulāyā...... |

to cover the altar in this way. The way it can be done is explained in the commentary. 
The praugaciti is divided into 24 rows west-east (Fig. 54), 12 on each side of the perpendicular line from the vertex to the middle of the base, and marked 1, 2, 3.............. 12. Bricks are placed as follows :—

15.3. Placement of bricks in the first layer. BC is divided into 18 equal parts and marked and likewise GH in 18 equal parts and marked. Lines parallel to BC and GH are drawn. It is easily seen that the entire area is divided into 144 rectangles where an equal number of bṛhati bricks can be placed and into 36 half rectangles along the sides where an equal number of ardhyās can be placed. Thus we get 180 bricks. The deficit is met by replacing 10 B1s in the 6th vertical row on either side of the central line GH by 20 B2s. With the above substitution, the total number of B1s is 124 and that of B2s 76.

CHAPTER 16 
THE CONSTRUCTION OF A FIRE-ALTAR IN THE FORM OF A 
CHARIOT WHEEL (RATHACAKRACITI) 
215 
16.1-16.2. Fire-altars in the form of a chariot-wheel are of two types: (a) a square piece with four circular segments attached one on each side so as to give the whole structure a circular shape, and (b) a circular wheel provided with spokes. Both types. are used for sacrificial purposes and are described in this chapter. 
THE CHARIOT WHEEL WITH CIRCULAR SEGMENTS. 
16.3. The construction and brick types. The method of constructing a circle equivalent to that of a square area, in this case 7 sq. pu., has been given in rule 2.9 and has already been discussed. Fig. 59 represents the required circle of area 7 sq. pu., within which is drawn the largest possible square ABCD. The space bounded by each side of the square and the arc of the circle is called pradhi (segment); there are four such segments. 
Let the side of the square AB or AD be a and the radius of the circle AO be r.

Fig. 59 
In the above calculations, π has been taken to be 3.14. D. gives the value of r as 185 ang. 14 ti. (madhye śańkum nihatya pañcāśītiśatāñngulena caturdaśatilayuktena pariman- dala bhramayet). His value of a is 262 ang. 7 ti (tasya madhye viskambhārdhadvikaraṇyā (r √2) saptatiladhikayā dviṣaṣṭiśatadvayāngulayā samacaturaśram kuryāt). It appears that in giving these values Dvārakānātha used the more approximate correct value of л. The square bricks are then made with each side equal to the twelfth part of AD, which, according to D's value of the side of the inscribed square, is 21 ang. 29 ti (that is, 22 ang- 5 ti). 
16.4-16.5. Placement of bricks. 144 bricks of the type mentioned above can be placed within the square ABCD. In the segments, 6 such bricks are placed adjoining the middle side of the square and the remaining space is divided into 8 parts (Fig. 60 (a), (b)). Thus each segment contains 14 bricks and four segments account for 56 bricks, making the total number 200. Regarding the placement of bricks in each segment, D. explains as follows: pradhimulamadhye ṣaț caturaśră upadhāya tasya pradheḥ sesamaṣṭadhā vibhajet | upahitānām ṣaṇṇām pārsvayordve dve mukhe catasra iti [

ag, hg, ih and ji are curved. D. neglected the curvature of ag, but considered the rest by giving the values of the śara, the distance between the centre of the arc and the respective chord in each case. For hg, ih and ji, these values are 31 ti; 26 ti., and 25 ti. respectively. Calculation of arcs and their saras were obviously consi- dered important mathematical exercises in medieval India when these commentaries were prepared. 
In the second layer the inscribed square is turned such that its corner lies in the centre of each segment of the first layer in order to avoid the overlapping of the edges of the bricks between layers. 
THE CHARIOT WHEEL WITH SPOKES. 
16.6-16.11. The measurement and the construction of the wheel. For purposes of measure- ment of a wheel of this type, square bricks each of area sq. pu. are used. 
15 x 30 The total area of the fire-altar, 1 sq. pu. will therefore involve 
or 225 bricks. The side of each brick a is given by :

Fig. 61. Construction of the chariot wheel (rathacakra) fire-altar. 
Now, 225 is a squared number 152. A chariot wheel with spokes consists of the central circular part, the nave, the spokes and the outer circular rim, the felly. The spokes connecting the nave and the felly alternate with empty spaces. In the procedure suggested, an area equivalent to the empty spaces between spokes is first added and then removed. This area is here taken to be equivalent to that of 64 square bricks of the type described above, probably because 225 plus 64 make 289, a squared number 172. Hence the direction of arranging 289 bricks in the form of a square so that each side contains 17 bricks. This is done in two stages; at first 256 bricks are arranged in a square, each side containing 16 bricks, and then 33 bricks, -17 plus 16, are placed along two adjoining sides. In this way the square ABCD is formed (Fig. 61 ). 
In the central region of the above square, another square EFGH of 16 bricks is formed. As D. explains, it is constructed out of the central square of 25 bricks by putting 4 poles, one each at the centre of the corner bricks, at E, F, G and H, and then joining them. The square EFGH forms the nave (nābhi). 
In the same manner, another square IJKL is formed of 144 bricks, centrally placed within ABCD. This is again done out of a square of 169 bricks, each side containing 13 bricks. A pole is placed at the centre of each of the four corner bricks, I, J, K and L, and these poles are joined. The area between the squares IJKL and EFGH is equivalent to the area of 128 (144-16) bricks, half of which, that is, 64, is used for making the spokes (arā) and the remaining half (64 bricks) for the empty spaces (vedi). 
218 
BAUDHĀYANA-ŠULBASUTRA 
The space between the squares ABCD and IJKL, equivalent to 145 (289-144) bricks constitutes the felly (nemi). 
Then three squares ABCD, EFGH and IJKL are turned into circles of radii OM, OP and ON respectively, according to the method given in rule 2.9. The space between the felly and the nave, that is between the circles of radii ON and OP is radially divided into 32 equal parts and half of them, in alternate order, is removed. In this way, an area equivalent to that of 64 bricks is rejected, and the remaining area of the wheel with the nave, spokes and the felly is exactly equal to that of 225 bricks or 7 sq. pu. 
16.12-16.14. Placement of bricks in the first layer. The felly (nemi) is divided into 64 equal parts. We have seen that the annular space comprising the spokes and the empty spaces was divided into 32 equal parts by radial lines. These are projected into the felly, dividing it at first into 32 equal parts, and each part is then equally divided by radial lines confined between the outer and the inner circumference. Now a concentric circle passing through the middle of these two circumferences of the felly is drawn, dividing its space into 128 parts. Note that the area of each part lying outside the middle circumference is different from that lying within. Accordingly, two types of bricks are required to cover the felly, as D. points out -- hāhyāścatuḥṣaṣṭi | tāsāmekam karaṇam | antataścatuḥṣaṣṭi | tāsāmekam karaṇam | 
Fig. 62. Arrangement of bricks in the 1st layer (after Thibaut). 
Each spoke is divided into 4 parts, thereby involving the use of 64 bricks of four different types. Finally the nave is divided into 8 equal parts to make the total number of bricks in the first layer 200. Thus seven different types of bricks are required to cover the first layer-evam sapta karaṇāni | eṣa prathamaḥ prastāraḥ | evam fatadvayasampattiḥ -D. 
219 
COMMENTARY 
Fig. 63. Arrangement of bricks in the 2nd layer (after Thibaut). 
16.15-16-20. Placement of bricks in the second layer. The general principle of avoiding overlapping of cleavages of bricks in the two layers is to be kept in view. For this reason, a circle shorter by one-fourth ( OP) is drawn within the nave; its distance from the edge is therefore a quarter. In the felly, a concentric circle is drawn so that its distance from the inner edge is one-fourth the breadth of the felly (nemimabhyan- tarato nemipramāṇacaturthabhāge'tite parikṛṣet—D.) 
The annular space of the felly between this new circle and the outermost one is divided into 64 equal parts and filled with bricks of one type. Each of the 16 spokes extending from the newly drawn inner circle in the nave upto the newly drawn inner circle of the felly is divided into 5 parts and 5 different types of bricks are used. The spokes will thus involve the use of 80 bricks. In between spokes, in the region of the felly, there are 16 spaces, each of which is divided into two equal parts, and 32 bricks of another type are used to fill them up (arāṇāmantarāleṣu vedipradeśasamipe nemyām dve dve iṣṭake | ....tāsāmṣkam karaṇam | tā dvātriṛśat—D.). Likewise, there are 16 spaces in the nave between the spokes and outside the inner circle; 16 bricks of another size are used to cover them. The remaining central part of the nave is radially divided into 8 parts and 8 bricks of still another type are employed to cover them. In this way, the total number of 200 (64 + 80 + 32 + 16 + 8) bricks of 9 different types are used. With the 7 types used for the first layer, and 9 for the second 16 different types of bricks are used to construct the fire-altar in the shape of a chariot wheel with spokes.

17.7. Placement of bricks in the first layer. 6 B, bricks are placed on each of BE and HC, that is, along line between the two western corners and the points where the handle meets the body. The remaining space can be filled with 172 Bys,-160 in the body and 12 in the handle including part of the body. In this way 12 B1s and 172 B2s, totalling 184 bricks, can be placed. The deficit of 16 bricks can be met by using Bås in place of B1s and B2s. According to Dvārakānātha, 4 B2s at the end of the handle are replaced by 4 B1s and 4 B ̧s and 12 B1s along BE and CH are replaced by 24 B,s. Now we have 4 B1s, 168 B2s and 28 B3s. (asmin prastāre catasraḥ ṣasthyaḥ | aṣṭaṣaṣṭisatamadhyardhāḥ | aṣṭāvimśatirardhyāḥ |--D.) 
17.8-17.12. Placement of bricks in the second layer. The method of placement is very clearly explained in these sutras and is shown in Fig. 65. After placing 2 Bås, one on each of the two eastern corners, 13 B1s can be placed on the eastern side of the body. 10 Bs are placed on each of the southern and the northern side. The tail contains 9 bricks, -2 B1s, 5 B2s and 2 B1s. The remaining space in the body can accommodate just 130 Bs. The total number of bricks thus used is as follows: B1-15; B2-137; B, 22; total 174. There is a deficit of 26 bricks, which is met by B, bricks. According to Dvårakånåtha, after replacement of B2s by B2s, the number of bricks of different types stands as follows : B1 
15; B2 124;

18.1-18.6. The construction of the fire-altar. For purposes of measurements, the ṣoḍaśī square bricks of area sq. pu. or 900 sq. ang. (that is, 30 × 30 sq. ang.) are employed. Clearly, 120 ṣoḍaśi bricks equal 122 or 71⁄2 sq. pu., the area of the fire- altar to be constructed. This area equals 108000 sq. ang. After deducting the area of 1 ṣoḍaśi brick of 900 sq. ang., the balance of 107, 100 sq. ang. is converted into a square of which the side obtained by taking the square root works out to.327 ang. 9 tila. Dvārakānātha gives this value as follows: tasya mulamāniya navatilasahita- saptavimśatyangulasahita-ŝatatrayāngulapramāṇena samacaturaśram kṛtvā 
The next step is to convert the above-mentioned square into a circle by the method given in sūtra Bśl. 2.9. and already applied in the case of the fire-altar in the form of the chariot wheel. Let ABCD be the square of side equal to 327 ang. 9 tila. (Fig. 66 ). EFGH is the ṣoḍāśi brick placed at the middle of the eastern side AD of the square. With O as centre and OM as radius a circle equal in area of the square ABCD is drawn, cutting EFGH by the curved line (dhanurvakrā) IJ. The 
222 
BAUDHAYANA-ŚULBASŪTRA 
part of the sodasi brick IFGJ cut by the circle is transferred to the top of the remain- ing portion, as KEHL. Now, KIJL, whose area remains the same as that of a ṣoḍaśi brick, represents the handle of the circular trough (also called oṣṭha).

Square bricks are made with side equal to

PQ, that is, 21 ang. 26 ti (= &

The inscribed square PQRS is filled with 144 such bricks. 6 such bricks are placed in each of the four segments in the middle of, and touching, the square; 24 such bricks are placed in the segments. The remaining space in each segment is divided into 7 parts as shown in Fig. 67 (a), making their number 28. The brick in the centre of the segment in between the row of 6 bricks and the circumference of the circle is 30 ang. broad and is called pradhi madhyamā. With 2 bricks in the handle, as cut by the circle already described, the number of bricks in the first layer totals 198. The deficit is met by replacing 2 corner bricks within the square by 4 half bricks of the one- twelfth type diagonally cut.

18.10-18.11. Arrangement of bricks in the second layer. In the second layer, the inscribed square is turned such that the corners point towards intermediate directions Fig. 67(b). The square is filled with 144 one-twelfth bricks as before and 24 similar bricks are placed in the segments. The remaining space in each segment is also divided into 7 parts as in the first layer, making their number 28. To avoid overlapping of edges, the pradhi madhyamā brick is placed in the handle, and the space below is equally divided. The total number aggregates to 198. The deficit is met by replacing 2 one-twelfth bricks in the square by 4 half bricks. 
Types of bricks. The sūtras do not specifically describe the types of bricks. From the descriptions, it is, however, clear that nine types of bricks are used. B1, B2, B3, B and B types are used in each segment; B, and B, in the handle; B。 is used in the centre of the segment in one layer; and B,s are used to complete the number 200. The following particulars of the bricks are based on the commentary (Fig. 68).

THE SAMUHYA AND THE PARICAYYA FIRE-ALTAR. 18.12-18.15. These sutras deal with samuhya and paricayya fire-altars. These altars are circular in shape and constructed in the same manner as the chariot wheel without spokes. The samūhya is not covered with bricks, but by loose earth dug out from pits, as stated in the sūtra. 
The paricayya is, however, covered with bricks in concentric circles. According to Dvārakānātha, 6 equally spaced concentric circles (agnikṣetre samāntarālāni ṣaṇmaṇ- dalāni) are drawn. The central circle, the nabhi, is divided into 8 equal parts. Beginning from the nābhi, the second and the third annular spaces are each divided into 16 equal parts; the fourth annular space is divided into 32 equal parts; and the fifth and the sixth annular spaces are each divided into 64 equal parts. In this way, 200 bricks are completed for the first layer. There are six different types of 
COMMENTARY 
225 
bricks, for the dimensions of radial divisions differ from one annular ring to the other (pratimaṇḍalam karaṇabhedaḥ | evam ṣaṭ karaṇāni). In the other layer, concentric circles are drawn in the middle of each annular ring and the inner circle (of the first layer) is removed. Here also we have 6 concentric circles but of different radii. The division of the nābhi and the succeeding annular rings is the same as before; but the radial lines are to be drawn such that these do not coincide with those of the first layer. All these are done to avoid the overlapping of edges. Here also 6 different types of bricks are used. 
CHAPTER 19 
THE CONSTRUCTION OF FIRE-ALTARS IN THE FORM OF A PYRE 
(ŚMAŚĀNACIT). 
19.1-19.2. The fire-altar in the form of a pyre, as we shall presently see, is a trapezium. For its measurements and constructions as also for the bricks, a new unit has been introduced. Let p be this unit. According to rule 19.2,

BAUDHAYANA-SULBASUTRA 
The fire-altar is in the form of a trapezium ABCD, of which the western side BC is 2p units (= 170 ang. 12 tila), the eastern side AD is 3p ( 254 ang. + 16 tila) and the height, that is, the distance between AD and BC is 6p (509 ang. - - 2 tila) (Fig. 69). For the word trapezium, the word ekato'nimaddirghacaturaśra is used. It means a rectangle of which one side is shorter (than the opposite parallel side). The area of the trapezium is given by 
15 
2p × 6p + 2 × 6p = 15p2 = −2 sq. pu. = which satisfies the area of the agnikṣetra. 
71 sq. pu. 
First layer. For purposes of making the bricks, a rectangle ABCD is formed such that its length AB is 3p and breadth BC is 3p. From the mid-point E of AD, join EB, EC. EBC is an isosceles triangle (prauga) of area p2. 20 such praugas equal 15p2 or 7 sq. pu. and can be accommodated within the fire-altar. To attain the number 200, each such isosceles triangle is divided into 10 parts in the manner shown in Fig. 69(b). The sides EB, EC and BC are each divided into 4 equal parts by marking 3 equidistant points on each side. The points on the sides are joined with those on the base as shown, so as to obtain 4 isosceles triangles at the base and 6 double isosceles triangles above them. About the formation of such triangles, the commentator says: evam vibhakte pṛthvanikasthāḥ praugākārāścatasra iṣṭakāḥ | tatastisra ubhayataḥ praugākṛtayaḥ | tato dve | tata ekā cubukāntā | 
Regarding the placement of 20 isosceles triangles EBC of area ap2, a line EF is drawn in the middle of the body (Fig. 69a). In the eastern half, 11 such triangles can be placed, 6 with vertices turned west and 5 with vertices turned east. In

the western half, 9 such triangles can be accommodated, 5 with vertices turned west and 4 with vertices turned east. This represents the arrangement of bricks in which 80 praugas and 120 ubhayata praugas are used. 
19.5-19.7. Bricks and their placement in the second layer. The entire space of the fire-altar (agnikṣetra) can be divided into five large isosceles triangles of base p and height (from vertex to base) 6p. Three of them have their vertices turned towards west and the vertices of the two in between them are turned towards east. The two isosceles triangles, one on the southern side and the other on the northern, which have their vertices turned towards west, are bisected by perpendicular lines drawn from the vertex to the base (Fig. 71). The agnikṣetra is thus divided into three portions, (1) half isosceles triangle CDE on the southern side, (2) the half isosceles triangle BAF on the northern side, and (3) the rectangle BCEF in the middle. Note that, since ED and AF are each ≥þ, EF 
www 
BC 
=== 
2p. 
To make the different types of bricks, the half isosceles triangle on either side is divided into six parts (Fig. 70). AB, BC and AC are divided into three equal parts each by the points, a, b, c, d, e, and f. Join bc, ad, de and cgf. The space is thus divided into 3 half isosceles triangles Bbc, cdg and dce which constitute the first type of brick B1. Note that Bb = 2p, bc = g. Through the above division, we get the second type B2, the rectangular bricks abcg, Aagƒ and fgde, of which the sides are 2p and p . The third type B, called the bṛhati, is a rectangular brick ABCD (Fig. 70(b)), of which AB p and AD p. The fourth type B is half bṛhati (Fig. 70(c)), a rectangular brick measuring p/4 by p/6. 
4 
The arrangement of bricks in the second layer is shown in Fig. 71. 3B1s and 3 B2s are placed in each of the two half-isosceles parts of the fire-altar. 8 B1s are placed on the eastern and the western parts each of the rectangular part of the fire- altar, with the longer side turned north-south. (Note that 2p/p = 8). These two rows use up up and the remaining vertical distance is (6p—g) — 172. The remaining space in the rectangular part of the fire-altar can be divided into 17 horizontal and 8 vertical rows in which 136 B bricks can be fitted with their longer sides turned east. Thus, the number of bricks used in this way totals as follows : 
B1 
6; B2 6 ; Bз 
3 
3 
136; B4- 16; total 
164. 
There is still a deficit of 36 bricks. According to the commentator, the deficit can be met by replacing 36 B, bricks (9 from each of the 4 corners) by 72 B1s. Dvārakā- nātha says: pārśvayorupahitapraugārdhayordvādaśeṣṭakāḥ | madhyabhūtacaturaśra (pūrvā) parāntayoḥ ṣoḍaśārdheṣṭakāḥ | madhye şaṭtrimsacchalam bṛhatyaḥ prāgāyatāḥ | evam catuḥṣaṣṭi satamiṣṭakaḥ ṣaṭtrimśannyūnā bhavanti | śronyamseṣu nava nava bṛhatiścaturasrakṛtā uddhṛtyāṣṭādaśāṣṭāḍaśārdhyā nidheyāḥ | evam dviśataḥ prastārāḥ | 
19.9-19.11. These sūtras deal with the height of the fire-altars and do not call for much comment.

CHAPTER 20 
THE CONSTRUCTION OF FIRE-ALTARS IN THE FORM OF A TORTOISE 
(KŪRMACIT)—FIRST TYPE WITH TWISTED LIMBS 
20.1-20.2. Fire-altars in the form of a tortoise are of two types, (1) the tortoise with twisted limbs (vakrāngāḥ) and (2) the tortoise with rounded limbs (parimaṇḍalāḥ). The construction of the first type is described in this chapter. 
= 
20.3-20.7. The construction of the fire-altar. A square of side 10 prakamas or 300 ang is first constructed and the four corners are cut off by 30 ang (that is, an isosceles tri- angle of two equal sides, each 30 ang is removed from each corner. A B C D E F G H is the shape of the body thus obtained (Fig. 72). Note that AB CD EF HG 60√2 ang. and BC DE FG AH = 180 ang. Four squares, each of side 30 ang. are placed side by side in contact with the middle of the eastern side of the body AH. Outer halves of the two side squares are diagonally cut off so as to get the figure a b c d. Note that ab equals 60 ang. Similar figures are constructed in the middle of the other three sides of the body BC, DE and FG.

The head is constructed by placing a rectangle on ab (ab of which length or height is 75 ang; the two eastern corners are then cut off by 30 ang each so as to get the shape efabg for the head. 
For each foot, a rectangle 30√2 ang. broad by 60√2 ang long is placed in the middle of the cut off corner, say on HG for the south-east corner. Thereupon, the eastern corner of this rectangle is cut off by 30√2 ang so as to obtain hijk for the shape of the foot. Similar constructions are made upon EF, CD and AB to build the remaining feet.

20.12-20.15. The placement of bricks in the first layer. As per sūtras, 1B, is to be placed at the tip of the head and below it 2 B5s (Fig. 73). In each foot 5 Bes and 2 B2s are placed as shown in the figure. In the remaining space, B2s are placed wherever the corners are cut diagonally and B1s in the rest. Clearly, the number 200 cannot be arrived at in this way; so B1s are replaced by Bos as necessary. According to the commentary, this can be done in the following way. Excluding the feet, the whole space of the fire-altar can be divided into 12 vertical rows, 6 on the southern side of the line passing through the centre of the body and the tip of the head and 6 on its northern side. In the first 6 rows from the southernmost one, the arrang ement is as follows :-

as 
21.2-21-4. The construction. Here the method of construction is the same that already described in the case of the circular trough (chapter 18). We have seen that 120 sodasi bricks equal 71⁄2 sq. pu. 5 ṣoḍaśi bricks are taken out and the area of the remaining 115 ṣoḍaśis (103500 sq. ang.) is turned into a square of side 321 ang. 24 ti (the commentator's value is 321 ang. 25 ti). This square is transformed into a circle of the same area as per Bśl. 2.9. In this act of circling the square, each of the 5 ṣoḍaśī bricks is cut by the circle and the western portion transferred to the eastern side. In this way, each of the 5 şoḍasi bricks is rounded off, one of them forms the head and the remaining 4 are attached to the circle in the 4 intermediate directions (Fig. 75). 
The next step is to draw within the circle a square of the maximum possible area. The side of the inscribed square, as we have calculated, works out to 256 ang. 25 ti. 
21.5-21.9. The side of the inscribed square, 256 ang. 25 ti is divided into 12 equal parts, and squared bricks are formed with side equal to each such part, that is, 21 ang. 13 ti which agrees with the value of the commentator (trayodaŝatilasahitaika- vimsatyanguleneṣṭakaḥ). But the commentator's value of 255 ang. 19 ti for the side of the inscribed square is inaccurate inasmuch as it leads to 21 ang. and 10 ti as the side of the square brick and not 21 ang. 13 ti as mentioned. 
ĀPASTAMBA-SULBASUTRA 
CHAPTER 1 
CONSTRUCTION OF SQUARE, THE THEOREM OF SQUARE ON THE 
DIAGONAL AND THE VALUE OF √2 
Apastamba summarized the knowledge of geometry and related problems in the first three chapters. The first chapter deals with various methods of construc- tion of square, the theorem of square on the diagonal of a square and rectangle, and the calculation of the value of √2. 
1.2-1.3. Construction of a square. Two methods of construction of a square are discussed here. These rules are essentially the same as those of Baudhāyana (Bśl. 1.8 and 1.5). 
1.4-1.5. Theorem of square on the diagonal. The rule says, AB2 + BC2 
AC2, where AB and BC are the sides of a rectangle ABCD. We have discussed this sūtra in detail under B§l. 1.12 and 1.13. Only the last line of Ã§l. 1.4, which contains the term tābhirjñeyabhi requires to be explained. According to Bürka, "the construction (found in Ãśl. 1.2 and 1.3) has been taught by means of (the application of) these (akṣṇayārajju, pārśvamānī and tiryaṁmāni of a rectangle), of course, by means of such as are recognizable (i.e. which can be expressed in recognizable numbers).” jñā means 'to know'. Various terms like jñātumsakti, iti vijñāyate, tābhirjñeyābhi have been used by the sulbakāras. According to Datta ", these can be interpreted as "known from the ancient scriptures". 
The sūtra Āśl. 2.5, undoubtedly a special case of Ãśl. 2.4, defines the diagonal of a square a as dvikarāņi or √ē a. This has been discussed in Bśl. 1.9-1.11. 
1.6. Value of √2. Extactly the same sūtra of Baudhāyana for the value of √2 is given here by Apastamba. This has been discussed under Bśl. 2.12. 
1.7. Construction of a square. This sūtra describes another method of construction of a square, not given by Baudhāyana. In Fig. 1, XY represents the given cord. T, U,V are marks at the middle of the cord XY, and of XT and TV respectively. EF is the east-west line. E, M, O, N, F are poles corresponding to X, U, T, V and Y.

As in the dronacit, there are four segments. 6 one-twelfth bricks are placed in the middle of the segment in contact with the inscribed square and the remaining space is divided into 7 parts as shown in the Fig. 75. The breadth of the brick in the centre of the segment (pradhi-madhyamā) in between the square bricks and the circumference must be 1 prakrama or 30 ang. as in the dronacit.

Fig. 75. Arrangement of bricks in the circular kürmacit,– 
(a) 1st layer; (b) 2nd layer. 
In the first layer, there are 144 square bricks inside the inscribed square, 24 square bricks in the segments and 28 bricks of different types in the remaining space of the pradhi. This makes 196 bricks. Now the pradhi-madhyama is pushed into the head and the vacant space thus created is filled with 2 bricks. The four feet are filled with 8 bricks of two types obtained in the process of cutting the ṣoḍaśi square bricks by the circle of the body as referred to before. The total now becomes 206, that is, 6 bricks in excess of the required number of 200. This is adjusted by replacing 18 square bricks by 12 1 square bricks. (aṣṭādaŝa caturaśra uddhṛtya dvādaśādhyardheṣṭakā upadadhyāt). 
In the second layer, the inscribed square is turned so that its four corners now point towards east, south, west and north. The placing of the bricks is the same as in the first layer with the difference that the placement of bricks in the feet is as in the case of the head of the first layer and that in the head as in the feet of the first layer. The adjustment is made as before. 
The remaining sūtras 21.10-21.13 do not call for much comment.

Similarly, the other corner points A, B, C are obtained. Hence ABCD is the required square. 
CHAPTER 2 
CONSTRUCTION OF SQUARE, SURD, A SQUARE FROM A COMBINA- TION AND DIFFERENCE OF TWO SQUARES, AND TRANSFORMATION 
OF A RECTANGLE INTO A SQUARE 
This chapter mainly deals with the methods of construction and transformation of geometrical figures like square and rectangle, already dealt by Baudhāyana. 
2.1. Construction of a square. Apastamba des- cribes here an interesting method of cons- truction of a square. In Fig. 2, EW represents the east-west line, 2a; XU the given cord, a; XV the saviśeșa of a, √2a; and Vr the half cord, a. 
The cord XY is prepared for its use in the construction of the square.

The knots at X and Y are tied at ◊ and E respectively and the cord is stretched by the mark V, which gives the south-east corner D. Then the knot at E is taken off and fixed at W. The cord is likewise stretched by the mark V, which fixes the south-western corner C. The process is repeated in the north-eastern and the north-western side. ABCD is the required construction of the square. 
2.2-2.3. Surd. Dvikaraņi means √2 a, where a is the measure; likewise tṛkaraņi is √3a, 
1 
and tṛtiyakaraṇi = √3 a. For details vide our discussion under Bśl. 1.9-1.11. 
2.4-2.6. Āpastamba's methods for making a square out of a combination or differ- ence of two squares are exactly the same as those of Baudhāyana, discussed in B§l. 2.1-2.2. The sūtra Āśl. 2.6 is an application of the combination of two squares, for instance a2 + 3a2 4a2, where a is the measure or producer of the square. 
2.7. The same method of transformation of a rectangle into a square as given by Baudhayana in his Bŝl. 2.5 is discussed.

CHAPTER 3 
TRANSFORMATION OF A SQUARE INTO A RECTANGLE AND A CIRCLE, OF A CIRCLE INTO A SQUARE, AND CONSTRUCTION AS WELL AS ENLARGEMENT OF SQUARES OF DIFFERENT MEASURES FOR SURFACE MEASUREMENTS 
The chapter deals with the transformation of squares into rectangles and circles, and of circles into squares. The methods given are the same as those by Baudhāyana. Moreover, Apastamba has given an idea of surface measures and methods of enlargement or construction of different squares. 
3.1-3.2. Square into a rectangle and circle. The sūtra Ãśl. 3.1 describes the method of transformation of a square into a rectangle. This has been discussed in detail under Bśl. 2.3-2.4. The methods of transformation from square into a circle given in Asl. 3.2 and B§l. 2.9 are exactly the same; for discussion, vide B§l. 2.9. 
3.3. Circle into a square. This is the same as that of Bśl. 2.10-2.11 (second method). 
3.4-3.10. Squares of different measures and enlargement of areas. One unit in length produces one square unit area; two units produce four square areas, and three units nine square areas, and so on. Pramāṇamātreṇa daṇḍena pramāṇamātram kṣetram vidhi- yate | dvipramāṇena daṇḍena catvāri pramāṇakṣetrāni bhavanti (Sundararāja)a. The sutra Asl. 3.7 explains that if ABCD be a square of p units, it produces p2 unit squares. If ABCD be a rectangle whose length AB has p units and breadth BC q units, then ABCD contains pq unit square areas (Fig. 3). According to Kapardib : yāvatpramāṇa yāvadāyāmā rajjuḥ tāvato vargānkaroti pańkti karoti | yāvat saṇkhyā yuktam pramāņaṁ tāvat samkhyāyuktaḥ pańktiḥ karoti | pañcamānam pañcasaṇkhyā yuktānvargān karoti | This has been beautifully explained by Karavinda as follows: dvipramāṇapārśvamānikam- ekapramāṇatiryaṁmāniyakam dvidha' pacchidya dve upalabhyete | dvipramāņa pārśvamānikam tripramāṇa tiryanmānīkam prāk dvidhodak tridha' pacchidya şaḍupalabhyante / This result

The method of enlargement of a square of side a by an increment of length x is obtained by (a + x)2 : a2 + 2ax + x2, where ABCD is a square of side AB a, and BE DH increment x (Fig. 4). For obtaining (a + x)2, two rectangles of area ax are joined at two sides of the original square and a small square of side x is added at the corner. This formula is given by Euclid II.4.

CHAPTER 4 
RELATIVE POSITIONS AND DISTANCES OF GARHAPATYA, AHAVANİYA AND DAKSINĀGNI AND CONSTRUCTION 
OF DARSIKYĀ VEDI 
4.1-4.4. Āpastamba has assigned here the relative places of gārhapatya, āhavaniya and dakṣiṇāgni. Baudhǎyana's second method is given by Apastamba. For detail, vide B§l. 3.1 - 3.5. 
4.5-4.6. Apastamba has followed Baudhāyana's method of construction of dāršikyā vedi (vide Bśl. 3.6-3.8). The only difference is that Baudhāyana used an isosceles trapezium whereas Apastamba took a rectangle.

THE METHOD OF ONE CORD (EKARAJJUVIDHI) AND TWO CORDS (DVIRAJJUVIDHI) AND THEIR USE IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF CERTAIN ALTARS 
5.1-5.2. Construction of mahāvedi by one cord (ekarajjuvidhi). Āpastamba has described here a method for the construction of the mahāvedi (or saumiki vedi) with one cord (ekarajjuvidhi)a . It is an isosceles trapezium, having face 24 prakramas, base 30 pra- kramas and height 36 prakramas,.

First set: From relation 32 + 42 
(i) (3 + 3.3)2 + (4 + 3.4)2 
i.e. 122 + 162 202.

(ii) (3 + 4.3)2+ (4 + 4.4)2 = (5 +4.5)2 
i.e. 152 + 202 252. 
Second set: The relations are : 
(i) 52 + 122 132 
(ii) (5+2.5)2 + (12 + 2.12)2 = (13 +2.13)2 
or 152 +362 392.

5.7 : Area of mahāvedi. The mahāvedi covers an area of 972 sq. padas. The rule gives hints how to calculate the area by proper transformation. The method is described here. The isosceles trapezium ABCD denoting mahāvedi has face, 24, base 30, and 
COMMENTARY 
239 
height 36 padas. For measuring the area, the portion DCL is cut off and placed in the northern side after inverting it and its new position becomes AKB (Fig. 6 ). 
Now the area ABCD

E 
EF × BL

972 square padas. 
{BL = } (AD + BC)] 
It is to be remembered in this connection that the area of the rectangle was already known to Apastamba (Ã§l. 3.6 and 3.7). The units of mahāvedi are given in prakramas and sometimes in padas. padas are sometimes calculated in terms of prakramas (vide Bśl. 4.12 - 4.14), though both of them are relative units (vide also Āśl.6.2).

or 10√3, and altitude or 12√3, √3 and has an area 324 sq. padas. For detail, vide Bśl. 3.12. 
6.1. Aśvamedha vedi. Āpastamba has given hints to the construction of similar isosceles trapezium of area 1944 sq. padas for the aśvamedha vedi. Its area equals 36√2 × § (24 √2 + 30√2) or 1944 sq. padas: This is double of the size of the mahāvedi. Hence, for an isosceles trapezium of n times the size of the mahāvedi, n being an integer or a fraction, only the unit of measurement of the latter should be replaced by Vn times the side of the mahāvedi. 
6.2. The unit of prakrama has been discussed (Bśl. 4.12-4.14) and Aśl. 5.7). Four officiating priests are usually required for the sacrifice, namely, adhvaryu, hotṛ, brāhmaṇa and the āgnidhriya. The adhvaryua should sweep the ground of altars three times and trace out the drawing with the help of the wooden sword. 
6.3-6.4. Nirudapaŝubandha vedi by one cord. The construction of the nirudapaśubandha vedi is done according to ekarajju measure taught in Āśl. 5.1 and 5.2. Here the relation,

The construction of another isosceles trapezium having face 3 aratnis, base 4 aratnis, and altitude 6 aratnis, has been obtained by the method of one-cord (ekarajju- vidhi). Here the following relation is used:

272 + (11)2= (291)2 
The sada is also a rectangle of length 18 aratnis and breadth 10 prakramas (Bśl. 4.1 ff) where relation, 182 + (7)2 = (191), holds good. For uparavas, vide Bŝl. 4.1.-4.2.

CHARACTERISTICS OF AGNI, GENERAL LAY-OUT AND CONSTRUC- TION OF CATURAŚRAŠYENACIT, ENLARGEMENT OF UNITS, HEIGHT 
OF VEDIS AND BRICKS 
8.1-8.5. The characteristics of agni have been discussed under Bŝl. 5.7-7.3. The general lay-out of the caturaśraśyenacit is given in Ãśl. 8.2; the ātmā that is, the body of theCOMMENTARY 
241 
fire-altar measures four sq. purușas, either wing and tail is each of one sq. purușa, together with an increment of 24 ang. in length for the wings and 12 ang. for the tail. This has already been discussed in Bśl. 8.10. For the construction of a fire-altar of 81 or more sq. purusas, Āpastamba has followed the same rule as given by Baudhāyana (vide Bśl. 5.1-5.6) for proportionate increment of square purușas from the agni of 7 sq. purusas. 
9.1-9.5. Construction of square. Here two methods of drawing a square required for the construction of the body (ātmā) of caturaśraśyenacit are described. The first method is explained in Fig. 7.

Four such squares each of 1 sq. purușa form the body (ātmā) of the caturaśraśyenacit. How any increment to the area of more than 7 fold agni is to be effected has already been discussed in Bśl. 5.1-5.6. 
9.6. Bricks of caturaśraśyenacit. Five kinds of bricks used for the caturaśraśyenacit are described as follows: 
242 
ĀPASTAMBA-SULBASUTRA 
pañcami, square bricks of side one-fifth of a purusa, 24 ang. × 24 ang. ; adhyardha, rectangular brick, 36 ang. x 24 ang. ; 
ardhyā, a rectangular half of pañcami, 24 ang. × 12 ang. ; 
caturbhāgiyā, a square brick one fourth of pañcami, 12 ang. × 12 ang. 
pañcadaśabhāgiyā, a square brick of side one-fifteenth of a purușa 8 ang. × 8 ang. The heights of bricks in most cases are the same with the exception of the nāka- sada and pañcacoḍā bricks, which have the height of the normal bricks used for altar construction. The pañcacoḍā and nākasada bricks are usually used at the top (vide Bśl. 5.7-7.3). 
CHAPTER 10 
CONSTRUCTION OF A RECTILINEAR SYENACIT 
10.1-10.3. The method of arranging bricks of size one-fifth of a purușa and those derived from them in a rectilinear syenacit is described in this chapter. The first three sūtras indicate the procedure for the first layer. The bricks to be used and already described in 9.6 are:

The arrangement of bricks is shown in Fig. 9 The adhyardă-pañcami (B2) bricks at each juncture of the wing with the body are placed such that 24 angulas lie within the body and 12 angulas in the wing, as explained by the commentators (ātmānama- ratninā prādesena pakṣamityarthaḥ-Karavinda). In the tail, the B2 bricks on each side may start from the upper end at the junction with the body, leaving 12 angulas (prādeśakṣetra) at the end, as it appears from Sundararāja, or from the western end of the tail leaving the prādeśakṣetra adjacent to the body, as is preferred by Karavinda. Both Sundararāja and Karavinda place 2 B1 bricks at each end of the prādeśakṣetra and 4 Bs in the middle (Fig. 9(a)). Kapardi places 2 B2s in the middle flanked on each side by 3 B1s (Fig. 9(b)). In the former arrangement, the number of bricks total 166, and in the latter 168, as detailed in Table I.

10:4-10.6. In describing the arrangement of bricks in the second layer in these sūtras, care is taken that the edges of bricks in the two layers do not meet. This is achieved by placing 10 B2 bricks turned towards north or south along the southern and the northern side of the body and interchanging the arrangement of bricks between the tail and the wing. Thus B, bricks placed at the juncture between the wing and the body in the first layer are now placed at that between the tail and the body, with 1 aratni or 24 angulas lying within the tail and 12 angulas within the body. (tāsāmardheṣṭakāmātrāṇyātmani bhavanti/pucche'ratnimātrāņi/Sundararāja.). Since 12 angulas of these bricks project into the body, these are covered, according to the commentators, by 5 Bgs to enable the filling up of the remaining space with B1s. In the first layer, 5 B2s lined each side of the tail. This arrangement is to be followed in the case of the wings for the second layer with the modification that on each side of the wing the number of B2s should now be 6 because of the extension of the wing by one aratni. The different types of bricks arranged in the above manner total 163, as mentioned by Karavinda and in Fig. 10 and Table 2.

Now, 37 bricks are still required to make the number 200. According to Kara- vinda, 4 B1s, one each from the body, the wings and the tail, are replaced by 36 B¿s; 5 B1s in the middle of the easternmost row in the body are replaced by 10 B ̧s.

aņuka means one-fourth of a purușa, i.e. 30 añgulas; aratni has already been explained; urvasthi stands for one-sixth of a purușa, i.e. 20 añgulas (puruṣasya ṣaṣtḥo bhāga ūrvasthi- Karavinda). pāda is a quarter; by using it with bricks of size one-fourth, one-fifth etc. of a purușa, their quarter bricks are indicated. 
11.5-11.8. The plan of placing bricks in the first layer is shown in Fig. 11. The number of bricks used in different parts of the fire-altar, as per explanations of the commentators, are shown in Table 3.

The direction for the placement of 8 B bricks on each of the two ends of the wings and at their junctions with the body is clear. About the four corners of the body, the commentators explain that 4 B1s should be placed at each along west-east or east-west. At the junctures, these bricks lie 6 angulas within the body, leaving a rectangular space 228 × 120 ang2 in the body (sandhāntarāla) to be filled by B2 bricks and their quarters, B5. Clearly, there can be only 9 rows of 5 B2 bricks each, Table 3. Bricks in different parts of the citi, first layer; following Kapardisvāmi, Karavindasvāmi and Sundararāja

leaving a rectangular strip which can be fitted by 10 B, bricks only. According to Kapardi and Karavinda, the B, row is to be so placed that there are 25 B2s south of it and 20 Bs north of it (as shown in Fig. 11). (tāsam dakṣiṇataḥ pañcavimśatiḥ pañcamabhāgiyāḥ | uttarato viṛśatiḥ (). Sundararāja prescribes the opposite, saying that the other arrangement is also permissible. The remaining space in each wing can be filled by 16 B1s and that in the body by 28 B1s. 
As regards the tail, the direction in the sutra being insufficient, the commentators have suggested different arrangements. Kapardi places 4 B,s on each side at the western corner of the tail, 13 B2s in between and above and 8 B1s in the remaining eastern part of the tail (Fig. 11 (a)). Karavinda divides the tail in two parts filling the western part by 15 B2s and the eastern by 8 B1s (Fig. 11(b)). Sundararāja takes prādeśa to mean prādeśakṣetra, which can be filled by 10 В5s (pucchāgre yatpravṛddham prādeśakṣetram tadupadadhyāt sāmarthyāddaśabhiḥ prādeśaḥ(); the remaining space is filled by 16 B1s. The last one appears to be straightforward. 
1 
To complete the number 200, Sundararāja's arrangement shows a deficit of 11 bricks. From the western half of the tail 2 B1s (one from each side) are replaced by 8 Bs; in the eastern half, 4 B1s in the middle are substituted by 9 Bgs. Karavinda's deficit of 14 bricks is met in the following way: 1 B1 in the body immediately above the fifth row of bricks (in the sandhāntarāla) is replaced by 9 quarter B, bricks (that is, 10 × 10 ang2); 2 B2s, one each from the western corners of the tail, are replaced by 8 Bs. Kapardi's deficit of 8 bricks can be met by replacing 1 B1 by 9 quarter B2s, as in the case of Karavinda.. 
2 
11.9-11.11. In the arrangement of bricks in the second layer, 5 B2 bricks are placed at the juncture between the tail and the body, half of them lying on either side. 14 Bgs are placed around the aforesaid bricks, 10 east of them and 2 on each side. The remaining space in the body can be filled with 94 bricks, thus accounting for 113 bricks in the body with the junction, of which B2s are 99 and Bs are 14. In each wing 30 Bs are placed, so that there are 60 bricks in the two wings. In the tail, following Karavinda, 9 B, bricks are placed in the upper half immediately after the junction bricks, in three rows,-two on the sides and one in the middle.

In this way 194 bricks are accounted for. To complete the number of 200 bricks, the following adjustments are proposed by the commentators. There are 10 rows, south-north, in the body, including bricks at the juncture. 10 B,s in each of the 2nd and the 9th row are replaced by 8 B1s each and 10 B2s in the 6th by 20 B¿s, with a gain of 6 bricks to make up the deficit. The arrangement of bricks with these adjustments is shown in Fig. 12 and their distribution over various parts in Table 4. 
CHAPTER 12 
FIRE-ALTARS OF AREAS ONE-FOLD AND UPWARDS, AND FIRE- ALTARS IN THE FORM OF ISOSCELES TRIANGLE, RHOMBUS AND 
CHARIOT WHEEL 
12.1. The side of an one-fold fire-altar of area 1 sq.pu. is 120 ang; that of a six-fold fire-altar is 293 ang 31 tilas. Baudhāyana (Bśl. 5.8-5.15) has discussed the question of fire-altars smaller than 7 sq. pu.. Here it is maintained that no fire-altar smaller than the seven-fold should be used, although some teachers uphold the legitimacy of fire-altars from 1 to 6 sq. pu. Such smaller fire-altars may be constructed but then only in the form of praugas, rathacakras etc. 
12.3. The kamyas (desires) are different forms of the seven-fold fire-altar. Guņas (qualities) are six in number (Karavinda). For guṇavikāra see Āśr. 14.1, 1). 
THE FIRE-ALTAR IN THE FORM Of an Isosceles TRIANGLE (PRAUGACITI) 12.4-12.6. The fire-altars in the form of isosceles triangles (prauga) are discussed in these sutras. The prauga has been likened to the fore part of a cart (śakaṭa-mukha). The method of transforming a square (or a rectangle) into an isosceles triangle has been discussed by Baudhayana (Bśl. 1.7). The construction of a fire-altar in the form of an isosceles triangle and the various types of bricks employed are fully discussed in Bśl. 14.1-14.8. Baudhāyana advises the use of rectangular bṛhatî bricks and their triangular halves and quarters by cutting the bṛhatis diagonally. 
248 
APASTAMBA-SULBASUTRA 
Apastamba advises the use of isosceles triangular bricks of different sizes, as explained by his commentators. Since the isosceles triangle ABC formed out of the square EBCD is 1 sq. pu. we have (Fig. (13(a)): 
BC= AF = √15 pu AB 300 √3 ang = 
= 464 ang 22 ti (approx.) 
= 120 √15 ang 519 ang 21 ti. (

The one-twelfth brick, abc, for the first layer has each of its two equal sides one- twelfth of AB or AC and the base one-twelfth of BC The half bricks are obtained by dividing abc vertically by af, and the quarter bricks by joining the mid- points g, h, f of the three sides (Fig. 13(b)). Sundararaja prescribes the use of one- ninth bricks by trisecting the three sides of the one-twelfth brick and joining them, as shown in Fig. 13 (c). For the second layer, one-thirteenth and their sub- divisions are used. The dimensions are:

B', half of one-thirteenth-39 ang 33 ti; 35 ang. 25 ti; 17 ang 29 ti. All these values agree with Karavinda's. Dimensions of quarter and one-ninth bricks are not given. 
COMMENTARY 
249 
If for the first layer, the two sides and the base are divided into 12 equal parts and the dividing points joined parallel to the sides and the base, the whole area will be divided into 144 isosceles triangles, each to be fitted exactly by the one-twelfth brick. The number 144 can be computed by permutation because, starting with one triangle at the apex it increases to 23 at the 12th layer with a common difference 2. For the second layer, where the sides are to be divided into 13 equal parts, there are likewise 169 triangles, each to be exactly fitted by one-thirteenth brick. Thus Sundararaja says: prathame prastare catuścatvārimśacchatena dvādasibhirudicyo dvadasa ritayaḥ |...aparasmin prastāre trayodaśibhiḥ navaṣaṣṭiśatena trayodaśa ritayaḥ | To complete the number of 200 bricks, in the first layer, 16 one-twelfth bricks in the middle four rows are replaced by 64 quarter bricks, and the apical brick is replaced by 9 one- ninth bricks, thus making up the deficit of 56 bricks. In the second layer, in place of 7 one-thirteenth bricks, 20 quarter and 18 one-ninth bricks are added to make good the deficit of 31 bricks. 
THE FIRE-ALTAR IN THE FORM OF A RHOMBUS (UBHAYATA PRAUGA). 
12.7-12.8. For the construction of a rhombus or two isosceles triangles on either side of the common base, Baudhyāyana's rules, Bśl. 2.8 may be referred to. The seven- fold fire-altar in the form of a rhombus, with the types of bricks to be used, has been discussed by Baudhāyana (Bśl. 15.1-15.6). In the case of the rhombus fire-altar, the bricks are to be made as in the case of the praugaciti, and these should be in the form of a rhombus, as Karavinda explains (karaṇāni cayanavidhiśca praugavat | viseṣaḥtūbhayataḥ praugāḥ iṣṭakāḥ|) 
THE FIRE-ALTAR IN THE FORM of a Chariot WHEEL (RATHACAKRACIT). 
12.9-12.10. These two sūtras and the first three (13.1-13.3) of the next chapter deal with the construction of the fire-altar in the form of a chariot wheel. Apastamba refers to the same type of rathacakraciti, as discussed in detail by Baudhāyana (Bśl. 16.1-16.5) and explained in the notes concerning these sūtras. 
CHAPTER 13 
CONSTRUCTION OF FIRE-ALTARS IN THE FORM OF A CHARIOT 
WHEEL (RATHACAKRA) AND A TROUGH (DRONA) 
13.1-13.3. As mentioned in the previous chapter, these three rules are in continua- tion of sūtras 12.9 and 12.10, dealing with the construction of a rathacakracit. This type has been fully discussed in connection with Baudhāyana's rules describing such a fire-altar (Bśl. 16-16.5). 
THE FIRE-ALTAR IN THE FORM OF A TROUGH (DROŅA). 
13.4-13.16. Of the two types of fire-altars in the form of a trough (droṇa), the square type in which both the body and the handle are squares is here described. The 
250 
APASTAMBA-SULBASUTRA 
circular type is not discussed. Baudhayana, as we have noticed, discussed both the types, square-type in rules Bśl. 17.1-17.12, and the circular type in Bśl. 18.1-18.11. 
In Apastamba's droṇaciti, the relative areas of the handle and the body of the trough are different from those prescribed by Baudhayana. The area of the seven- fold fire-altar being 108000 sq. ang., the handle measures 10800 sq. ang. and the body 97200 sq. ang. The area of the square body is 9 times that of the square handle and therefore the side of the handle is one-third of the side of the body. The sides 
are :

103 ang. 31.28 ti. 
The bricks are formed by the twelfth part of the side of the body, and out of such dvadasi square bricks, adhyardha (one side longer by half), quarter bricks etc. are formed, of which specifications are as follows:

B and B are used to make the total number of bricks in a layer equal to 200. Sundararaja mentions one-ninth bricks. 
The arrangement of bricks in the first and the second layers, for which the directions in the sūtras are quite clear, are shown in Fig. 14(a) and (b). In the first layer, 24 B2 bricks are placed,—12 on the eastern side, 4 each on the two western

1COMMENTARY 
251. 
second layer, the rule prescribes the use of 32 Bas,-24 in the body and 8 in the handle; the remaining space can be filled with 112 B1s, making the total number 144. The deficit in either layer is made up by replacing the required number of Bis and Bas by quarter bricks. 
CHAPTERS 15, 16 AND 17 
CONSTRUCTION OF A FIRE-ALTAR IN THE FORM OF A FALCON WITH CURVED WINGS AND EXTENDED TAIL-FIRST TYPE 
We have already met with Baudhāyana's construction of two types of fire-altars in the form of a falcon with curved wings and extended tail (1st. type, Bśl. 10.1- 10.20, 2nd. type, Bśl. 11.1-11.13). Āpastamba gives the construction of two other types, of which the first one is described in these three chapters, and the second one in chapters 18 to 20 to follow. We have thought it convenient to deal with these three chapters together because of the continuity and overlapping of the subject 
matter. 
15.2. In the falcon-shaped fire-altar, a head is to be provided, the tail should be spread out and each wing must be curved. According to rule 15.2, the curving of the wing is to be done by pushing the west side upwards and the east-side down- wards. Karavinda explains that what actually should be done is to raise upwards towards east the first half of the wing from its root at the body to the middle and to press downward towards west the second half from the middle to the end. (prathama pakṣārdham mūlādārabhya paścātprabhṛti prāgunnayet |.. dvayam pakṣārdham madhyā- dārabhya purastāt prabhṛti pratyagunnayet /). The method is further explained in rule 
15.6. 
15.2-15.5. Areas of different parts of the falcon. A simple rectilinear syenacit, as we have already noticed (Bśl. chs. 8 and 9; Ãśl. chs. 10 and 11), consists of a square body of 240 × 240 sq. ang. (4 sq. pu.), two rectangular wings each of 144 × 120 sq. ang. (11⁄2 sq. pu.) and a rectangular tail of 132 × 120 sq. ang. (1 sq. pu.). Some areas are taken out from the tail and the body (ātman) of the rectilinear fyenacit to build up the head and extend the area of each wing in the following manner : 
1 
Area taken out of the tail-120 × 12 sq. ang. or sq. pu. 
1 
Area taken out of the head-(120 × 120 + 8 × 900) sq. ang. or 11⁄2 sq. pu. Caturbhāgiyā is the area of a square of side 30 ang., that is 900 sq. ang. 
The area of the head, which is built out of 3 caturbhāgīyās, is 2700 sq. ang. or 1 sq. pu. 
The area of the tail, after the prādeśa portion is taken out, is 14400 sq. ang. or 1 sq. pu. 
The area of the body, after 11⁄2 sq. pu. are taken out, is 23 sq. pu. or 36,000 sq. ang. Since the area taken out of the tail and the body less that used for making the head is added to the wings, the area of each wing is determined as follows :

The area of two extended wings 2 × 120 × 2283 sq. ang. or it sq. pu. The rules direct to increase the length of the rectangular wing without changing its breadth of 1 purușa or 120 ang. The new length of the extended rectangular wing is clearly 228 ang. or 9 aratnis plus ang., according to the definition of the units given in rule 15.4. This new length of the wing is stated in rule 15.5. Note that the total area, after distribution, of the fire-altar, remains 7 sq. pu. (= 38% +1 + § + £1).

15.6. The wing. For the construction of the wing, a rectangle ABCD is taken, such that AB equals 120 ang. and AD 2283 ang. (Fig. 15(a)). Upon BC and AD, the triangles BFC and AED are constructed. BF, CF, AE, DE each equals 120 ang. AEDCFB is the new shape of the wing in which the bending (nirņāma) takes place at E and F.

At each of the 4 corners an isosceles triangle of side equal to 60 ang. is formed and cut off from the rectangle by transverse lines EL, FG, etc. as shown. The length EF at the eastern and IJ at the western side equals 60 ang., GH on the southern and KL northern side equals 120 ang. The area of the figure EFGHIJKLE exactly equals 36,000 sq. ang. or 21⁄2 sq. pu. 
COMMENTARY 
253 
15.8. The tail. The rectangle ABCD, of which AB equals 120 ang. and AD 60 ang. is flanked on its southern and northern sides by two rectangles DEFC and AGHB which are cut off by the diagonals DF and AH respectively, leading to the figure ADFHA which is the shape of the tail (Fig. 15(c)). AD equals 60 ang. and HF 180 ang. 
15.9. The head. A square ABCD of which each side equals 60 ang. is constructed (Fig. 15(d)). From the mid-point E of AD, EF and EG are drawn to the mid-points F and G of DC and AB respectively. EFCBGE is the shape of the head. 
Note that either side of the wing AB, CD will join exactly with either the south side GH or the north side KL. Similarly, the base of the head BC will fit in exactly with the eastern side EF of the body and the eastern side AD of the tail with the

16.2-16.10. Types of Bricks. Nine types of bricks have been used in covering the alternate layers of this fire-altar. These are : 
______ 
= 
= 
B1 the first type,-a parallelogram abcd, of which ab = cd = 24 ang. and ad bc 20 ang. (Fig. 16). The sides are parallel to those of the paralle- logram ABEF or CDEF, so that this type can fit in the wings. Sundararāja gives the values of the longer diagonal ac as 35 ang. 20 ti and of bd as 26 ang. 6 ti. He also gives the breadth ed between the longer sides as 19 ang. 2 ti, which is of 2281 ang. (the length of the wing). 
B2 
B2 the second type, obtained by joining 2 B1s along the longer side such that the brick is bent at the middle (madhye nirṇatā ekapārsve unnatā- Karavinda) and suitable for use in the wing at the bending (17.5). the third type, obtained by joining the parallelogram abcd (B1) with the rectangle aefb along ab; ae = 15 ang. This is so designed that it can be used at the junction between the wing and the body, abcd lying within the wing and aefb in the body (17.5). 
B3 
B1 — the fourth type, obtained by first making the square abcd of side equal to 30 ang. extending it by half defc, and then cutting off the square by the diagonal bd; defbd is the brick, used in several places. de

16.11-17.4. Placement of bricks in the first layer. The placement of bricks in the first layer is best explained in Fig. 17. In each wing 60 B1s are placed, with their longer sides, 24 ang. directed towards north. There are 10 rows east-west, each accommodating 6 B1s. 
In the tail, 8 Bgs are placed on either side, in two groups each containing 4. Karavinda explains the disposition as follows-pucchāgre tisraḥ tāsām purastādekam | evamuttarasmin pārsve viparyasya kāritāḥ | At the junction between the tail and the body, 2 BAs are placed in such a way that the portion diagonally cut lies in the body. West of them are placed 2 Bs. The space now left in the tail consists of a rectangular strip, 30 ang. × 60 ang., followed west of it by two equal rectangular strips, each 30 ang. × 120 ang. ; 10 B ̧s (2 + 4 + 4) can be placed in these three strips (17.1).

The body (atman) can be divided into three distinct rows, east-west by the lines GH, FI, EJ and LK. The breadth of each row is 60 ang. In the four corner regions, 4 equal areas EQRL, FMNG, IOPH and JSTK can be marked out such that EQ FM ΟΙ 
NG = PH = TK JS = 75 ang.; and RL of these four corner areas, 2 BAs can be placed, with their diagonally cut edges point- ing outwards and with their longer sides turned either towards east or west. (ātmanaḥ śronyamseșu dve dve bahyaviśeşe-Sundararāja). Still an area 30 x 30 sq. ang. is left,

which can be filled by 1 B5 and 2 B ̧s, thus requiring 4 B ̧s and 8 BÅs as stated in the rule 17.2. The rectangular area MNPO and QRTS each measures 60 × 90 sq. ang. and can accommodate 6 B1s each. In the central row 14 B1s can be arranged as shown, leaving two isosceles triangular spaces of side 30 ang. Kapardi calls the central row viŝayānām mārga, as bricks at the junctures (apyaya) partly lie on either side; he also confirms 14 B1 bricks in this row-viśayānām mārge tiryagātmani caturdaśa caturthyaḥ / The space available in the head together with the two isosceles triangular areas can be exactly filled with 4 B bricks as shown.

17.5-17.10. Placement of bricks in the second layer. The arrangement of bricks of different types is shown in Fig. 18. In each wing, after placing 5 Bas at the bending and 5 B2s at the juncture between the wing and the body such that the extended rectangular part (15 × 24 sq. ang) lies in the body, the remaining space can accommodate 45 B1s. 25 B1s lie on the southern side and 20 B1s on the northern side of the bending in the southern wing. In the northern wing the arrangement is opposite. 
In the tail, 5 B, bricks are placed on either side, and the whole space is divided into 5 rows west-east. In the second and the fourth row from the bottom 1 B each is placed by the side of the B,s on either flank. This makes the total number of Bs 12. (evam dvādaśa saptamya upahitā bhavanti |-Karavinda). The remaining space in the tail is covered by 13 B ̧ bricks.

18.1-18.2. These sūtras are repetitions of 15.1 and 15.2. 
18.3. Areas of different parts of the falcon. One-sixteenth or soḍaśi square bricks are used here for purposes of measurements. The same method was used by Baudhāyana for measuring the circular dronacit (Bśl. 18.2). As already explained, the area is sq. pu. or 900 sq. ang., that is, a square of side pu. or 30 ang. Clearly, 120 soḍaśi bricks make 7 sq. pu. On this basis, measurements of the different parts of the fire-altar are as follows:

Note that the areas of the head and the body are the same as those of the first type of the falcon. Shapes of the different parts of the falcon are now described. 
18.4. The body. It agrees with the body of the first type of falcon not only in area but also in shape (vide 15.7, 16.1). It is only differently described. One starts with the same rectangle of breadth 11⁄2 pu. or 180 ang. and length 2 pu. or 240 ang. The four corners are cut off, each by an isosceles right triangle of side 60 ang. (Fig. 15(b)). The area of each such triangle is 1800 sq. ang. equivalent of 2 soḍaśi bricks, so that a total of 8 bricks are taken out from 48 bricks that the rectangle holds, leaving an area equivalent of 40 bricks. Regarding the cutting of the corners, Kapardi advises the construction of 4 squares of side pu. and cutting them off diagonally—yathā śroṇyamseṣu catvāri caturaśrāṇi ardhapuruṣapramāṇāni kṛtvā akṣṇayānyārdhāni nirasyet. 
258 
APASTAMBA-SUVLBASUTR 
18.5. The head. This is done in the same way as the head in the first type (Fig. 15(d)). Α square of side 60 ang. contains 4 șoḍaśis of which 1 is removed by the cutting off of the two eastern corners as described in the rule. 
18.6-18.8. The wings. A sq. pu. equals a rectangular area, 120 ang. long by 71 ang, broad. If this area is added to the rectangle, 240 ang. × 120 ang. along the common side 120 ang., we get the rectangle ABCD so that AB CD 120 ang. and AD BC= 247 ang. (Fig. 19(a)). About the addition of 71⁄2 ang. to the side 240 ang., Kapardi says puruṣaṣoḍaśabhāgāścārdhonāṣṭārgulamātram dakṣine pakṣe cāyāmaḥ| 
At the end, the rectangular strip EDFC of breadth 30 ang. is made and divided into 4 squares, 30 × 30 sq. ang. each. Each square is diagonally cut and the outer half removed. ABCD whose area is 2 sq. pu. is equivalent of 33 ṣoḍaśi bricks. An area equivalent of 2 sodasis is discarded by diagonally cutting the 4 squares, leaving an area equal to that of 31 ṣoḍaśi bricks. 
In the middle of the rectangle less the portion where four squares were drawn up, the east-west line GHI is drawn perpendicular to the sides BF, AE. BF is 2171⁄2 ang. and BI 108§ ang. The point H on the east-west line is obtained by stretching a cord or a rod of 1 pu. such that BH equals 1 p.u. (Sundararāja explains-pakṣasya sardhasaptadaśadviśatāngulasya madhye lekhām kṛtvā pakṣāpyasyāparānte puruṣamātram venum niyamya tasyām lekhāyām nipatayet | så yatra nipalati lekhāyām tatra nitodam kuryāt | ) 
The point G is obtained by making GH equal to 1 pu. GA, GE, HB and HF are joined. Each of these sides equals 1 pu. Thus ABHFEGA together with the 4 diagonally intersected half squares EK,L1, L1KL, L,K,L, and LCF at the south end represents the shape of the southern wing. The northern wing is obtained in the same manner.

259 
COMMENTARY 
these 18 squares are 18 ṣoḍaśīs, that is, 18 sq pu. or 900 × 18 sq. ang. The required side is therefore 1√18 pu. or 30/18 ang. The point is explained by Karavinda as follows: aṣṭādaśa karotītyaṣṭādaśakaraṇi | ṣoḍaśīnām prakṛtatvātṭāsām aṣṭādaśānāṁ karaṇi | te khalu triṣoḍaśipramāṇanavatyangulasamacaturaśrasyākṣṇayābhūte / Thus, Karavinda puts it as the diagonal of a square of side 90 ang. (Fig. 19(b)), which again equals 30V18 ang. That the area of the tail is equivalent to that of 15 ṣoḍasis is clear from the figure. 
19.2-19.8. Types of bricks. 6 types of bricks have been used in covering the alternate. layers of the fire-altar. These are-

The brick suitable for use at the end of the tail (pakṣāgriyā) broken in the form of four triangles. It consists of two parts, e.g. parallelogram abcd and the triangle ecd, and is a combination of B and B2 joined about the common side pu. The inclination is so adjusted that the parallelo- gram part fits in the parallelogram part and the triangular in the triangular part of the wing. 
19.9-20.4. Placement of bricks in the first layer. The placement of bricks is clearly explained in Fig. 21. The rules start with the placement of B, bricks, -4 at the tip of the head ABC, 5 west of the line DE, 11 east of the line KF joining the eastern points of juncture of the wings with the body, 11 west of JG, the western line of juncture, 5 each on the eastern and the western side of IH, the junction line between the tail and the body, and finally 15 at the end of the tail LM. Thus 56 Bs are used (tã evaitāḥ ṣaṭpañcāśatpādeṣṭakāḥ—Kapardi). 
4Bs are placed at each end OP of the two wings, such that the triangular parts cover the triangular ends and the parallelogram parts part of the adjoining para- llelogram of the wing. 4 B¿s are placed at either junction FG, JK of the wings with the body such that the triangular parts lie in the body. The total number of B ̧s used is 16. North of FG and south of JK each, 4 B1 bricks are placed in the body with their diagonally cut sides fitting exactly with the similar diagonal sides of the Bes. The remaining space in either wing is covered by 4 B5 at the bending MN and by 40 Bas, -20 B1s each on either side of the bending; Bs are turned eastwards. (catvārimsată catvāriṛśatā pakṣeṣṭakābhiḥ prāgāyatābhiḥ pakṣau pracchadayet-Karavinda). 
The spaces of the fire-altar now left out are in the head between the rows of B, bricks, in the body between the B ̧s at the eastern and western ends and in the middle enclosed on east and west sides by Bs and on south and north sides by B1s, and in the tail between Bgs at the juncture and the end. These spaces are to be

covered by B1s, such that at the inclined edges at the four corners of the body and the two sides of the tail, the diagonal sides (†√2 pu., saviśeṣāh, as Kapardi explains) face outwards; elsewhere 2 B1s lie with their diagonals touching each other so as to form a rectangle 60 ang. x 30 ang., as the geometry clearly indicates. The number of bricks and their types in the different parts of the fire-altar are given in Table 7.

20.5-20.12. Placement of bricks in the second layer. In the second layer, 2 B1s are placed at the tip of the head with their diagonal sides facing outwards. West of them 2 B1s are placed, partly covering the head and the body, but with their diagonal sides. facing inwards. There are two ways of doing it, as shown in Fig. 22(a) and (b). The space between the two diagonals is filled by 2 B2s on each side of the 2 B1s at the juncture, 1 B1⁄2 being placed with its diagonal side facing outwards. Thereafter, B1 bricks are to be placed at the corners of the body. Bürk, in his Fig. 63a, placed 6 such bricks,-2 in the eastern and 4 in the western corners. All commentators have interpreted rule 20.7 as the placement of 4 B1s, one in each of the 4 corners (śronyamseṣu catasraḥ ṣoḍaśyo vahyaviseṣāḥ pratyantaviseṣaḥ Kapardi. tāsām sandhiṣu... 
2 
..sodasyaḥ catasrah-Karavinda.) The placing of 2 B,s,-one on either side of the western corners, to maintain the symmetry with the eastern corners, has also been suggested. The rules then direct the placement of 4 Bgs at the end of each wing, 6 B2s at both sides of the tail (3 on each) and B1s in the wings turned towards north 20.8, 20.9). From the geometry of the wing, it is clear that the parallelogram spaces in either wing can be divided exactly into 56 (7 × 8) small parallelograms for containing 56 B1s. Bürk's Fig. 63 shows 64 (8 × 8) which is incorrect. About 56 B1s, Kapardi says: ṣatpañcāśadviparyasya kāritāḥ; about 7 rows south north, in the wings, Karavinda's statement is : pakṣayorudicyaḥ pakṣeṣṭakāḥ sapta ritayaḥ | 
■ Bürk, 385 
262 
ĀPASTAMBA-ŚULBASUTRA 
Rule 20.10 directs that the remaining space in the body and the tail is to be covered by B1s. Now, after covering the body with 4 B1s and 4 B2s and part of 2 B1s at the juncture with the head (total area covered is equivalent of 7 ṣoḍaśi bricks), a space equivalent of 33 șoḍaśi bricks remains to be filled up; in the tail, the space yet to be covered is clearly that of 12 ṣoḍaśis. Hence, Karavinda's comment-- avaśiṣṭamātmani trayastrimśat ṣoḍaśŝisthānam pucchadvādaśa ṣoḍaśisthānam. With 18 bricks placed in the head, body and tail, 120 in the two wings and 45 sodasi-spaces, the total number comes to 183. Then the geometry of the remaining space in the body is such that only 30 B1s can be accommodated and the remaining three soḍaśi spaces (30x30 sq. ang.) can be covered by 4 B2s and 4 B2s (20.11). In that way, Kapardi arrived at 188 bricks, still short of 12 (evam dvādaśonam śatadvayam () The arrangement of 188 bricks is shown in Fig. 22(a). 
The deficit of 12 bricks can be met by replacing 12 B1s by Bs and Bs, as indicated in 20.11. The role of aṇukās, 30 × 30 sq. ang., in parallelogram form is not properly understood, for the same objective can be achieved by half bricks (B2).

However, a complete scheme explaining how 200 bricks can be laid in the second layer has been given by Karavinda. There is no change in the arrangement of bricks in the two wings, totalling 120. Accordingly, the placement of bricks in the head, the body and the tail only is shown in Fig. 22(b). The head and its juncture with the body are covered, as in Fig. 22(a), by 4 B1s and 2 B2s; at the juncture the dispositions of 2 B1s and 2 B2s are reversed: sirasi prānmukhe bāhyaviseṣe dve ṣoḍaśyau upadadhyāt | tayoḥ paścāt prāňmukhe bāhyaviśeṣe visaye dve ardhe | tayoḥ

The second row has 2 B1s at the western corner end, then 1 B1, 6 B¿§, again 1 B1 and 2 B2s, of which the one at the eastern corner has already been mentioned. There are thus 12 bricks (dvādaśeṣṭakā eṣā |) In the third layer, starting from west of the juncture line AB upto the line of juncture CD in the tail, there are 8 B1s, of which 4 are turned eastwards and 4 westwards: tṛtiyasyam rityām siro’pyayaṣoḍaśyāḥ paścă- dārabhya āpucchāpyayamaṣṭau ṣoḍaśya upadheyāḥ | tāsām catasraḥ prācyaścatasraḥ praticyaḥ| The arrangements in the 4th, 5th and 6th rows are the same as those in the 3rd, 2nd and 1st respectively.

KĀTYĀYANA-ŚULBASŪTRA 
CHAPTER 1 
DRAWING OF EAST-WEST LINE, CONSTRUCTION OF SQUARES AND 
FIXING THE PLACES OF THE AHAVANĪYA, GĀRHAPATYA, DAKSINĀGNI AND UTKARA ALTARS 
The Katyayana-sulbasutra, in six chapters, is essentially a geometrical work containing the main principles of geometry and some problems involved in altar construction. Kātyāyana has made some reference to different vedis and agnis without any details of their construction with bricks and tried to explain geometrical results as such. In this chapter he has dealt with the method of drawing east-west and north-south lines, the construction of squares and the determination of the relative positions of ahavaniya, gārhapatya, dakṣiṇāgni and utkara altars. 
DRAWING OF East-West anD THE NORTH-SOUTH LINES

NX

W 
Fig. 1. 
Let E and W be the eastern and western shadow points on the equinoctial day of the pole fixed at 0 (Fig. 1). Apte suggests that the actual east-west line was determined by the shadow of the pole on the equinox day and verified by the rising and setting points of the star Kṛttikā. Then EW is in east-west or prăci line. Two knots are given at the two ends of a cord which is double of the original cord and are fastened at the poles at E and W. The cord is then stretched towards north by its middle point and a mark N is given at it. This is the north point. Similarly south

point S is obtained. Then NS, gives the north-south line. In the Sulbasūtras the east- west line has always been drawn first presumably because of the importance attached to this direction. 
CONSTRUCTION of a Square or a Rectangle 
1.3 This gives a general method of construction of a square or a rectangle. In a given cord marks are given for śroņi, amsa and nirañchana points. Two knots are fixed at the two ends of the cord; then fixing the two ends of the cord to the poles at the two ends of the east-west line, the cord is drawn by the nirañchana mark on either side of the line. By interchanging the knots at the two ends, the operation is repeated. Further details as to the length of the cord corresponding to a given distance between the two poles (the length of the altar) and where the nirañchana mark is to be given are discussed in the subsequent rules. 
1.4-1.9. Rules 1.4 and 1.5 give direction for determining the nirañchana points and are used for the construction of square and rectangles.

The term tiryaṁmāni literally means 'transverse' or 'oblique' measure. In the Sulbasūtra, however, it has been used to signify the 'breadth' or 'shorter side' of a rectangle. Mahīdhara says: nirañchanenākarṣaṇe kṛte śronyamsa parichedikā jā rajjuḥ sā tiryańmāni. 
After finding the perpendicular lines to the east-west line with the help of any of the above cords, poles are fixed upon the perpendicular lines at a distance equal to half the measure from the prăci to obtain the square. For rectangle, poles are fixed at a distance equal to half the value prescribed in the text. 
The sakaṭamukha means a figure resembling the fore-part of a cart and represents an isosceles triangle. It is also constructed out of square or rectangle (Bśl. 2.7-2.8). The prāgvamsa is a rectangle (Bśl. 4.1), the śālā a rectangle (Mahīdhara) and the sada also a rectangle (Bśl. 4.4). In the construction of these altars the north-south line is considered the reference line. For construction, decrease and increase of measures of altars, Katyāyana followed the direction of older śāstras.

At the southern śroņi point D of this square (daksiņaśronyam) the fire is to be placed.

UNITS OF MEASURES, PAITṚKĪ VEDI, MEASURES FOR DIAGONAL, THEOREM OF SQUARE, COMBINATION OF SQUARES. 
2.1. 
Units of measures. Units like iṣā, akṣa, yuga and śamyā have been expressed here in angulas. This has been discussed under Bśl. 1.3. 
2.3. Paitṛki vedi. The paitṛki vedi has been dealt with by Baudhayana (Bśl. 3.11). 
2.3-2.6. 
Measures for the diagonal of a rectangle. Kâtyāyana has considered a parti- cular measure for a square as karaņi, so that its diagonal becomes tatkaraņi or dvikaraņi, (tat kṣetram dvaiguṇyādi kriyati ‘nayā sā tatkaraṇi—Mahidhara), for square on the diagonal is twice the original square. Likewise, the diagonal of a rectangle having sides as prāśvamānī and tiryaṁmāni is known as akṣṇayā. With the help of these technical terms Katyāyana has expressed the measures for the diagonal of a rectangle in the following two cases: 
and 
12 + 32 
22 + 62 
(VTO)2 (√40)2 
Other measures juga and famyā have been defined in Kśl. 2.1. 
2.7 Theorem of square. Kātyāyana here enunciates the general theorem of square on the diagonal of a rectangle in the same language as did Baudhāyana (Bśl. 1.12) and Apastamba (Aśl. 1.4). 
b 
At the end of the enunciation, he remarks, iti kṣetrajñānam. The term kṣetra has been translated as 'area' by Thibauta and 'figure' by Datta. In the śulbasūtra, the area is technically expressed by bhūmi (Bśl. 1.6 and 1.9) and not kṣetra. Hence iti kṣetrajñānam means 'this is the knowledge of plane figures'. 
2.8-2.9. Combination of two equal squares. Dvikaraṇi has been defined here as √2 a, where a is the measure. This is actually a method of combination of two equal squares each of side a into one of √/2a. Tritiyākaraṇi has been defined as navabhāgastraya of tṛkaraṇi :

3.1-.34. The rule 3.1 deals with the construction of a square equal to the diffe- rence of two squares, 3.2-3.3 the transformation of a rectangle into a square and 3.4 transformation of a square into a rectangle. These rules have been given by Baud- hāyana (Bśl. 2.2, 2.5 and 3.4 respectively). The transformation of a rectangle into a square, when it is very large, is specially discussed by Katyāyana, as has also been done under Bśl 2.5. 
3.5-3.10. These concern the areas of squares and rectangles and are essentially the same as those of Apastamba (Asl. 3.4-3.10) 
3.11-3.12. For circling a square and the quadrature of the circle,Katyāyana gives the same rules as those by Baudhāyana (Bśl. 2.9-2.11) and Āpastamba (Āśl. 3.2, 3.3).

VACIT, 
CONSTRUCTION OF DRONACIT, TRIANGLE, RHOMBUS, TRANS- FORMATION OF TRIANGLE AND RHOMBUS INTO A SQUARE 
4.1-4.2. Construction of dronacit. Kătyāyana discusses here the methods of drawing different squares required for the construction of droṇacit. First a square of area 7 sq. pu. is constructed and divided into 100 small squares by drawing ten parallel lines horizontally and ten vertically. Then small squares from one side are separated out and changed into a small square by the method of combination of squares (samāsa-vidhi), discussed in Kśl. 2.8 and 2.9. The remaining 90 small squares are likewise transformed into a single square. The former square is joined to the latter like a stalk. In the case of a circular droṇacit, the two squares mentioned above are

to be transformed into two circles and joined together (Mahidhara). Katyāyana's rule is basically different from that of Baudhayana (Bśl. 17.1.-18) and Āpastamba (Āśl. 13.4-5) and appears mathematically more sound. 
4.3-4.4. Construction of triangle and rhombus. These two rules are the same as those of Baudhayana (Bśl. 2.7-2.8). 
4.5. Transformation of an isosceles triangle into a square. For transformation of an isosceles triangle into a square, the isosceles triangle ECG is divided by the prāci line EF (Fig. 4). Now tr. ECF is transferred to the other side so that tr. EGH is now its new position. Thus tr. ECG is transformed into the rectangle EFGH. This rectangle is changed into a square by the sūtra Kśl. 3.2. It has also been discussed by Āpastamba (Ãśl. 12.4-12.8).

4.6. Transformation of a rhombus into a square. For transfor- ming a rhombus ENFS into a square, EF and NS, the east- west and north-south lines are joined (Fig. 5). The isosceles triangle NFS is clearly sub-divided into two triangles NOF and SOF. These are now transferred and after invertion placed in their positions as AEN and BES. Thus the rhombus ENFS is transformed into the rectangle ANSB. This rectangle is transformed into a square by the sutra Kśl. 3.2.

4.7. Transformation of a triangle into a square. Katyāyana has Fig. 5 Transforma- hinted for the first time at a method of transforming into a square a triangle other than the isosceles. The rule is, how into a rectangle. ever, incomplete. According to commentator Mahidhara, ekakarṇa means tulyakarṇa, i.e. a figure having equal angles and dvikarṇa nānāvidhakarṇa, i.e. a figure of unequal angles. Whether by nānāvidhakarṇa Mahidhara meant an irregular pentagon cannot be definitely said. Šulbakāras were well acquainted with the method of converting an isosceles triangle into a square. Possibly they had also the knowledge of trans- formation of a pentagon of equal angles into a square by joining the angular points, dividing it into several isosceles triangles, and then joining them up into squares by the rule taught before. Kātyāyana has advised to break up pañcakarṇas of dvikarņa variety into a square. But there is no such method known to the fulbakāras by which an irregular pentagon can be broken up into squares. Kātyāyana's pentagon ABCDE is of the type of hamsamukhi brick (Fig. 6), in which BF FC =

CHAPTERS 5 AND 6 
ENLARGED UNIT, CONSTRUCTION OF A SQUARE EQUAL TO N 
TIMES A GIVEN SQUARE AND EKĀDAŠINĪ FIRE-ALTAR. 
The whole of chapter 5 and the first five sūtras of chapter 6 are devoted to the discussion of enlarged unit required for measuring the areas of fire-altars from 81 sq. purușas to 101 sq. purușas. Most of these results agree with those of Baudha- yana and have been discussed under B§l. 5.1-5.6. In sūtra 6.2, Katyāyana says that ifs be the maximum enlarged unit in a prakrama for 101 fold fire-altar, then s2 equals 14 sq. prakramas. In the next sūtras he has pointed out that at each succes- sive constuction the value of the prakrama is to be increased by one seventh of the increased area, 
i.e. $2 
1 + 
p 
7 
or 752 
(1) 
7+p, where p is the increased area. 
For the construction of 101 fold fire-altar the total increment from the 7 fold one is 94. Putting a = 94.

since the enlargement in area starts from the normal 7 fold fire- 
altar, i.e. 71 sq. purușas. It may be that Kātyāyana simplified the rule for construc- tion of 101 fold fire-altar. 
Datta has suggested another rational of the formula (2) as follows. 
In the falcon-shaped fire-altar (second plan), the problem of proportionate enlargement is equivalent to the solution of the following quadratic equation:

6.7. Construction of a square equal to n times the given square. This method undoubtedly hints at the construction of a square which is equivalent to ʼn times a given square. Let n number of equal squares each of side a are to be combined. Šulbakāras used isosceles triangles for different constructions.

Construction of a fire-altar with enlarged areas was usually carried out by fixing the distance between the two poles (yupas) of ekādaśini. This distance is known as prakrama. The length of prakrama varies in the case of the enlarged fire- altar. There are various opinions on this point by ancient masters. This has been discussed under Bśl. 4.12-4.14. 
MANAVA-SULBASŪTRA 
The Mānava-śulbasūtra, in 16 chapters, is a mere compilation, and its value as a technical text appears to be of dubious nature. In most places it is corrupt, and the same topics are discussed in different places. The materials on gārhapatya, for instance are dispersed in chapters 1, 6, 9, 13, on caturaśraśyenacit in chapters 4, 5, 6 and 13, on dhisnyas in chapters 6, 9 and 13 etc. It is full of paraphernelia about worship hardly of any consequence to altar construction. The arrangement is unsystematic. The text therefore bears no comparison with the three other sulba texts already commented upon.

East-west line. Sūtras 1.2 and 1.3 direct the fixation of the east-west line of the altar according to cardinal points. The rule is incomplete. 
1.4-1.6. Dārśiki vedi. The dārŝiki vedi is in the shape of an isosceles trapezium having face 48 añg., base 64 arg., and altitude 96 ang. (Fśl. 3.6-3.7, Aśl. 4.5-4.6). The given verse is not very clear in describing the method of construction required for the purpose. Here the prăci is of 4 aratnis (96 ang) and the cord of 6 aratnis (144 ang) out of which a right triangle of sides 40, 96 and 104 is formed. By using this right triangle, the isosceles trapezium required for the dārsiki vedi is constructed. How the sides of the isosceles trapezium are cut off has been described by Baudhāyana and Āpastamba. 
1.7-1.10. Gārhapatya, āhavaniya, dakṣiṇāgni and utkara. Mānava describes āhavaniya as a square of one sq. aratni, garhapatya and dakṣiņāgni as circle and semi-circle of the same area. His incomplete method of circling a square appears to follow that of Baudhāyana, Āpastamba and Katyāyana (Bśl. 2.9, A§l. 3.2 and Kśl. 3.11). The method of finding the relative positions of these fires and of dakṣiṇāgni also differs from that given by other sulbakāras. 
1.11-1.12. Construction of a square. The rule gives a general method of construction of a square. If a be the original length of the cord, and a, the increased length of the cord, the nirañchana mark is given at a point dividing the total length 2a into two

By using this relation which satisfies the condition of a right-angled triangle, the required circle is drawn. This method resembles that of Baudhāyana (Bśl. 1.4- 1.5).

2.4. Pāśuki vedi. The method is incomplete and may be reconstructed as follows. The pāśuki vedi is an isosceles trape- zium having face 3 aratnis, base 4 aratnis, and altitude 6 aratnis. A cord AC (9 aratnis long) is used for its construction. Marks are given on it at B, N, S, M for obtaining prācī, nirañchana, śroņi and amsa points, such that AB equals 6 aratnis, AN 61 aratnis, BN, NS, SM eacharatni and CN 21 aratnis. This satisfies the relation AB2 + CN2 AN2 or, AC2 + CN2 AN2, when the ends A and C are fixed on the east- west line, i.e. 62 + (21)2 (61)2 holds. This is used for the construction of the isosceles trapezium DEFG (Fig. 1),the form of the pasuki vedi.

Māruti and varuņa vedi. The māruti vedi is also an isosceles trapezium having face 3 aratnis, base 4 aratnis and altitude 6 aratnis. A cord of length 12 aratnis is taken and the nirañchana mark fixed at 71⁄2 aratnis (§ + 2 + 2 + 1} + 1} = 7}) from one end; the remaining cord measures 41 aratnis (} + 1} + 1} + 1 = 41). This satisfies the relation 62 + (41)2 (71)2, which appears to have been used for the construction of the altar. A similar tedious technique is applied for the construction of the varuna vedi,a which is an isosceles trapezium having face 1 aratnis, base 2 aratnis, and altitude 6 aratnis.

2.6-2.7. Paitṛki vedi. This appears to be a rhombus in shape, and pointing towards the cardinal directions. Van Gelder quoted Śivadāsa who prescribed a cord of 8 aratnis with marks at 4 aratnis and 53 aratnis. This is obviously wrong, as these mark- ings do not lead to the relationship for a right triangle. Simply a cord of 10 aratnis long is taken up and two ends are tied to the prācī points E and W, where EW equals 51⁄2 aratnis. The cord is then stretched by the middle point on either side, fixing the points G and H. Hence EHWG is the required paitṛki vedi.

3.6-3.9. The sada is given as a rectangle, 27 x 9. Out of a rectangular area of breadth 10 angulas in the eastern side of the mahāvedi, the rectangle of breadth 21 ang, from east is for sikhaṇḍini vedi (vide Bśl. 4.12), and the next rectangle of 71⁄2 ang. is known as devyavedi. The description of kaukili vedi is not clear. According to Gelder, this represents an isosceles trapezium having prăci equal to 12 prakramas, base10 prakramas and face 8 prakramas.

Chapter 5 describes a method of measuring areas in a square syena (caturasra- fyenacit). 
Two bamboo rods are taken, one measuring 120 ang. (one puruşa) in length, the other 144 ang. In the second bamboo rod marks are given at a distance of 120 ang., 132 añg. and 144 ang. from one end. Two middle marks are given in these two rods at a distance of 60 ang. from the same ends. Then a pañcāngi cord is formed in the following way (vide Mśl 13.15). A cord AB of length 2 purușas (240 añg) is taken and three marks are given, one at the middle of the cord C and one each at the middle of the two halves, i.e. at D and E. (Fig. 2). The cord is fixed by two poles at its eastern end A and the western end B; poles are likewise fixed at C, D, and E. The two bamboo rods are then stretched towards south from D and E respectively so as to meet at F, 120 ang from the end of each. The first bamboo rod is held over CF so as to obtain G at 120 ang from C. Now the second bamboo rod is stretched from pole A towards south and the first rod from G towards east so as to meet at H, 120 ang from the end of each rod. H is the south-eastern corner of the

Fig. 2. Construction of a caturaŝraśyenacit. 
To construct the northern wing poles are fixed at L and M, the middle points of the two halves of the southern side HK. By stretching the two bamboo rods from L and M towards south the point N where they meet at a distance of 120 ang from the end is determined. The second bamboo rod is now held over GN and the point O 144 ang from G is obtained. Then by stretching the second rod from L and the first rod from 0 the point P is fixed and likewise the point Q, so that the rectangle LPQM constitutes the southern wing. Likewise the northern wing is formed. The area of each wing measures 120 × 144 sq. ang or 13 sq. pu and that of two wings 2 sq. pu. 
To obtain the tail, one has to proceed in the same manner as for the wing; but the mark with the second bamboo rod stretched from B westwards should be given at a distance of 132 ang. In other words, a rectangle 120 × 132 sq. ang or 116 sq. pu is to be formed. 
For the head a square 60 × 60 sq. ang (according to Śivadāsa, a rectangle of 60 × 75 sq. ang) is to be formed at the middle of the eastern side. 
In this construction, the body, the two wings and the tail (4 + 23 + 17%) account for 7 sq. pu, with the head needing an additional area and thus deviating from the traditional area of a fire-altar of this type. We have seen that Baudhāyana did not provide his square syenacit with a head and strictly restricted himself to the area of 7 sq. pu.

The height of these bricks is 6 ang.; the heights of nākasad and pañcacodă are half of these, but whether the heights of ṛtavyā and vaiśvadevi bricks are also half is not clear. Månava gives no idea as to how to arrange the bricks in the first and second layers (compare with MŚl. 13.6-13.13). The sūtra 6.7 is so vague and inadequate that no attempt has been made to reconstruct the arrangement of bricks. 
6.10. Āgnidhriya, hotriya, brāhmaṇācchaṛśa and mārjālīya. A similar description of āgnidhriya square of side 36 ang. divided into 9 equal parts with a stone being placed at the centre is met with in the Baudhayana-sulba. The descriptions of hotriya, mārjaliya and brāhmaṇācchamsa are different in different places (vide Mśl. 13.23-13.29). 
6.11-6.15. Caturafrasyenacit. The placement of bricks in two layers of caturaśraśyenacit is hinted at. Rectangular (18 ang×12 ang) and square bricks (12 ang × 12 ang., also 30 × 30 sq. ang) are used for this purpose. There is no mention of the total number of bricks required for each layer. What can be ascertained from the rules is that the first layer contains 98 adhyardhā (18 × 12) bricks (40 in the eastern and western sides of the ātmā, 48 in the eastern and western sides of the two wings and 10 in the head) and the second layer 72 adhyardhās (40 in the southern and northern sides of the ātmā, 22 on either side of the tail and 10 in the head). The remaining space is to be filled by square bricks. Van Gelder suggested 80 square bricks of size. 30 × 30 sq ang. and 128 square bricks of size 12 × 12 sq. ang. making the total for the first layer 306.a For the second layer the total number of bricks was likewise shown to be 269. Several other alternatives are possible, but that would be a futile exercise. 
The sūtra 6.14 lays down how to perform worships of three and six days. 
CHAPTERS 7 AND 8 
These two chapters describe the construction of suparnaciti, not found in earlier sulba literature. In this structure various bricks such as viśvajyoti, ṛtavyā, svayamātṛ, apasyā, prāṇabhṛt, vaiśvadevi, vāyavyā, chanda, virāja, vikarṇī have been used. The description is mostly of a general nature.

CHAPTER 9 
AREAS OF GĀRHAPATYA, DHIṢNYAS AND PLACING OF BRICKS 
IN DIFFERENT YAJÑAS 
The garhapatya is a square citi of 9216 sq. angulas. The square gārhapatya has side 96 ang. There are eight dhiṣṇyas, namely, āgnidhriya, māṛjāliya, and six others within the sadas, viz. hotṛi, maitrāvaruņa (or prasāstri), brāhmaṇācchamsin, potri, nestr and acchāvaka. Each dhiṣṇa has an area of 1296 sq. añgulas; a square dhiṣṇa is of side 36 ang. The fire-altar is 111600 sq. angulas in area. 
Now, 111600 sq. ang. 78 sq. pu. An area of 1 sq. pu. for the head is added to original 71⁄2 sq. pu. agni. Here the break-up is as follows (for measures vide Mśl. 11.2-11.8).

CHAPTER 10 
THE SULBAVID, ŚAŃKU, ROPE, MEASUREMENT OF VOLUME, 
PROPERTIES OF RIGHT-ANGLED TRIANGLE 
The qualifications of fulbabid and the nature of saňku and rope are described. The sulbabid is one who is versed in geometry (measurement of areas), calculations, and altar construction and who takes up as a profession the measurement of areas. 
278 
MĀNAVA-SULBASŪTRA 
The ground for the construction of altars should be plane, the sanku or poles must be straight and the cord smooth. 
For the volume measure (Msl. 10.9) length, breadth and height are multiplied. 
In a right-angled triangle, a2+ b2=c2 where a == length, b breadth and c = hypotenuse (Mśl. 10.10). 
CHAPTER 11 
UNITS OF MEASUREMENT, CIRCLING A SQUARE, AREAS OF PLANE FIGURES, VALUE OF T, QUADRATURE OF THE CIRCLE, USE 
OF PANCANGI CORD, MEASURES FOR DIAGONAL OF 
A RECTANGLE 
11.1-11.8. Units of measure. The units of human measure become short or long depending on the stature of the sacrificer. However, the table runs as follows : 1 yava=6 mastard seeds; 1 mastard seed=6 cords of hair; 1 aratni=2 prādeŝas; 1 prakrama=1 aratni or 2 prādeśas (in citi measure); 1 purușa=120 angulas=5 aratnis or 10 padas; 1 yuga==86 angulas; 1 akṣa=104 añgulas; the ratha measures are according to the prescription of the text. 
I 
11.9-11.10. Circling a square. The method of circling a square described by Mānava in Mśl. 1.8a is repeated. Here the word, viskambha meaning 'diagonal' has been used; it should be viskambhardha meaning 'radius'. This rule has been explained. by Baudhayana (Bśl. 2.9). 
= 
2a2; 
11.11-11.12. Areas of figures. If d be diagonal of a quare of side a, then d2 that is, the square on the diagonal produces twice the area of the original square; similarly D2 2d2 4a2, where D is the diagonal of the square drawn on the diagonal of the original square of side a; and so on. The area of a rectangle with breadth 2 pu. and length 8 pu is 16 sq. pu. (Mśl. 11.18). 
11.13. Value of π. Value of π. 
If c be the circumference, d the diameter of a circle, 
d 
C = 
5 + 3d = 3·2 d 
C 
or 
3.2. 
d 
Baudhayana has also given a similar approximate value of # as 3 (Bl. 4.15). 
11.14-11.16. Quadrature of the circle. Possibly these are not problems of quadrature of the circle. Ordinary squares are drawn without any mathematical significance. 
COMMENTARY 
279 
11.17. Properties of right triangle. The relations 32+42-52, and (3n)2 + (4n) 2 
(5n)2, where n is any quantity, hold good for any right-angled triangle. 
11.19-11.28. Measurement of śroņi and amsa points by pañcāñgi cord. How a cord with five marks (pañcāñgi) is used to measure the western (śroņi) and eastern corners (amsa) of citis other than kanka and alaja has been explained in a general way. 
CHAPTER 12 
DIAGONAL OF A RIGHT TRIANGLE 
This chapter deals with the method of calculating the diagonal of a right triangle when its other sides are known. Sometimes out of three sides any two are known, when the third can be calculated. The length is known as measure or pramāṇa or pārśvamāni, breadth veseșa or tiryaṁmāni, and diagonal akṣṇayā.

By applying this, two fold producer (√/2a), three fold producer (√3a), twenty- one fold producer (√21 a) used for the aśvamedha vedi, and 101 fold producer are obtained. 
This also justifies that 
12 + (V10)? = 11,

CHAPTER 13 
CONSTRUCTION OF SAUMIKĪ VEDI, GÄRHAPATYA (BOTH SQUARE AND CIRCULAR), CATURAŚRAŚYENA OF ANOTHER TYPE, ÄGNIDH- RĪYA, HOTRÏYA, BRĀHMANĀCCHAMŚA AND MĀRJĀLĪYA 
13.1-13.5 Saumiki vedi. Here the construction of sautrāmani, saumiki and paśubandha fire-altars has been hinted at. The saumiki fire-altar is in the form of an isosceles 
280 
MĀNAVA-SULBASŪTRA 
trapezium having face 8 √3, base 12 √3, and altitude 12 √3. This is meaningful (Ãśl. 5.8-5.9),but the description regarding the other two is not very clear. 
13.6-13.13. Construction of garhapatya vedi. The garhapatya vedi has two forms, e.g. square and circular, each covering an area of either one square vyāvāma or one square purușa. The fire-altar always contains 21 bricks in each layer. Mānava has given almost correct solution to each case. 
For square gārhapatya of one square vyāyāma, he advises like Baudhāyana, the making of 21 bricks each of length} of a vyāyāma and breadth of a vyāyāma (Mśl. 13.7). In the second layer directions of length and breadth are interchanged. 
For square gārhapatya of one square purușa, he advises the whole area to be divided into 18 rectangular parts each of length of a purușa and breadth of a purușa (Mśl. 13.8.-13.9). Clearly, each brick measures 40 ang × 20 ang. Three corner bricks are replaced by those of size, 20 ang × 20 ang. thereby making the number of bricks 21. In the next layer the length and breadth are interchanged. 
In the circular gārhapatya of one sq. purușa, a circle is drawn with a radius half a purușa. The altar is covered with 21 bricks by four types of bricks, the sizes of which are not given. This may be done by laying 12 square bricks of type I, 4 triangular bricks of type II of which one side is curved, and 4 bricks of type III, of which one side is curved and the other straight. One brick of type III is halved (type IV) to make the number 21. For the other layer the direction is only changed. 
13.14-13.22. Construction of caturasrasyenacit. This gives an incomplete description of another type of caturaśrasyenacit with pañcami (24 ang. × 24 ang.), adhyardhā (36 ang × 24 ang) pāda (12 ang. × 12 ang.), and ardhapāda (6 ang. × 12 ang.) brick. Admitting that the text is defective and the measures of bricks are uncertain, Gel- der has given a tentative plan, but we shall make no such attempt. Like the previous type it has a square body, 2 rectangular wings, a rectangular tail, and a square head. There is no mention that the citi is constructed with 200 bricks. 
13.23-13.29. Construction of agnidhriya, hotriya, brāmaṇācchaṛśa. Compare with Mśl. chapters 6 and 9. Dhiṣṇyās are squares of size 36 ang. × 36 añg., but the description is different at different places. 
CHAPTER 14 
VAKRAPAKṢA ŚYENA, KANKA AND ALAJA 
14.1-14.6. Parts of the body in syena, alaja and kanka. Measured with a square brick of size one-fourth of a purușa, the different parts of a syena, alaja and kaňka fire-altar comprise areas shown in Table 1.COMMENTARY

IT 
14.7-14.20. Layout of vakrapakṣaśyena. For measuring vakrapakṣałyena of 71⁄2 sq. pu. a cord with 12 parts has been used; each part is equal to 30 añgulas. The alternative of 123 parts does not agree with remaining directions. A rough sketch of both parts and brick structures are given by Gelder, which do not agree with the textual description. Four types of bricks are used for this purpose. They are square (40 ang. × 40 ang.), triangular (30 ang. × 30 ang., 30 √2 ang.), triangular half (30 ang., 15 √2 añg, 15 √2 añg.) and five-cornered bricks. There is no mention that the layer is to be covered with 200 bricks. 
CHAPTERS 15 AND 16 
PRAUGACIT, UBHAYATA PRAUGA, SAMŪHYA, 
DRONA, RATHACAKRACIT 
The descriptions are mostly inadequate for drawing the actual diagrams of ubhajata prauga, samūhya, droṇa and rathacakra fire-altars These can, however, be understood by reference to Baudhāyana and Apastamba. For praugacit a rectangle of 15 sq. pu. is to be drawn, and half of this area is required for the purpose. In the droṇacit of 1000 bricks, each layer is constructed with 200 bricks. Of two chariot wheels (rathacakracit) of different sizes, one has an area of 71 sq. pu. and the other three times as large.
