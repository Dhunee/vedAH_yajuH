## taittirIkaraNa

There were apparently taittirIyaka subschools that pronounced words like veshman (=house) as veshshppman. I have not yet heard of any modern practitioner from Mh, TN or A do that, though. The "taittirIyization" of a cluster of related KYV schools is an underappreciated topic.

> Indeed the school of Plākṣí does not make the increment here (TPr 14.10) while Plākṣāyaṇá's does (14.11). By 14.1 we should get véşşpp̃man normally, véşşman by Plākṣí, and véşpp̃man by Plākṣāyaṇá (14.17) and by Hārītá (14.18). I believe the yamá is universal in TPr (21.12). - nikhil


We would posit that the taittirIyaka-s & related KYVin serving as ritualists for the early Tam warlords& monarchs were likely following a distinct flavor of that school than the waves of later immigrants. However, that diversity had already emerged in the north& differentially transmitted to the southern realms rather than developing in situ in the south. 

One exception might be the idiosyncratic recitational style that developed among the early settlers still preserved by the nambus. An independent case of such idiosyncrasy is the mAdhyaMdina.
