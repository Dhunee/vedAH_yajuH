1. Now the gods, when going upwards, did not know (the way to) the heavenly world, but the horse knew it: when they go upwards with the horse, it is in order to know (the way to) the heavenly world. 'A cloth, an upper cloth, and gold,' this [^egg_815] is what they spread out for the horse [^egg_816]:

[^egg_815]: 320:1 The 'iti' seems superfluous; Harisvāmin explains it by 'etat trayam.' For a similar use of the particle, see XIII, 2, 2, 1.

[^egg_816]: 320:2 That is, they spread them on the ground for the horse to lie upon. Differently St. Petersb. Dict., 'they spread over the horse;' but see Kāty. XX, 6, 10 comm.; and Harisvāmin:--vāso yad antardhānāyālam, adhivāso yad āccḥādanāyālam, tac ca vāsasa upari staraṇīyaṁ, tayor upari hiraṇyaṁ nidheyam, tasmiṁs traye enam adhi upari saṁjñapayanti;--and he then remarks that these three objects here do not take the place of the stalk of grass which, in the ordinary animal sacrifice, is thrown on the place where the victim is to be killed and cut up (III, 8, 1, 14; Kāty. VI, 5, 15-16), but that the stalk is likewise put down on this occasion. Similarly the comm. on Kātyāyana, where it is stated that the stalk of grass (or straw) is first laid down, and then the others thereon. Indeed, as was the case in regard to the stalk of grass--representing the barhis, or layer of sacrificial grass on the vedi--so here the fourfold underlayer is intended to prevent any part of the sacrificial material (havis)--the victim in this case--from being spilt. The  upper garment (or cloth) must be sufficiently large to allow its being afterwards turned up so as to cover the horse and the queen consort.

thereon they quiet (slay) it, as (is done) for no other victim; and thus they separate it from the other victims.

2. When they quiet a victim they kill it. Whilst it is being quieted, he (the Adhvaryu) offers (three) oblations [^egg_817], with (Vāj. S. XXIII, 18), 'To the breath hail! to the off-breathing hail! to the through-breathing hail!' he thereby lays the vital airs into it, and thus offering is made by him with this victim as a living one [^egg_818].

[^egg_817]: 321:1 Prior to these, however, he offers the two 'Paripaśavya,' i.e. 'oblations relating to the victim,'--or, perhaps, 'oblations performed in connection with the carrying of fire round the victim,' for this last ceremony is performed for all the victims (whereupon the wild beasts placed between the stakes are let loose) before the killing of the horse. See III, 8, 1, 6-16.

[^egg_818]: 321:2 For the symbolic import of this, see III, 8, 2, 4.

3. With, 'Ambā! Ambikā! Ambālikā [^egg_819]! there is no one to lead me,'--he leads up the (four)

[^egg_819]: 321:3 These are just three variants used in addressing a mother (Mutter, Mütterchen, Mütterlein), or, indeed, as here, any woman (good lady! good woman!. Acc. to Kāty. XX, 6, 12, this is the formula which the assistant priest (the Neshṭr̥, or, according to others, the Pratiprasthātr̥, cf. Kāty. VI, 5, 27-28) makes the king's wives say whilst leading them up to the slain horse to cleanse it. It is, moreover, to be preceded by the formula used, at this juncture, at the ordinary animal sacrifice, viz. 'Homage be to thee, O wide-stretched one, advance unresisted unto the rivers of ghee, along the paths of sacred truth! Ye divine, pure waters, carry ye (the sacrifice) to the gods, well-prepared! may ye be well-prepared preparers!' (III, 8, 2, 2-3). The words 'Ambā!' &c. are, according to Mahīdhara, addressed by the women to one another. The latter part of the formula as given in the Vāj . Saṁh. (viz. 'the horse sleeps near Subhadrikā, dwelling in Kāmpīla') is apparently  rejected (? as antiquated, or inauspicious) by the author of the Brāhmaṇa. The ceremony of lying near the dead horse being looked upon as assuring fertility to a woman, the formula used here is also doubtless meant to express an eagerness on the part of the women to be led to the slaughtered horse, representing the lord of creatures, Prajāpati. On this passage compare the remarks of Professor Weber (Ind. Stud. I, p. 183), who takes the formula to be spoken by the queen consort to her three fellow-wives; and who also translates the words 'na mā nayati kaś cana' (nobody leads me) by 'nobody shall lead me (by force to the horse; but if I do not go) the (wicked) horse will lie near (another woman such as) the (wicked) Subadhrā living in Kāmpīla.'--Harisvāmin's commentary on this passage is rather corrupt, but he seems at all events to assume that each of the four wives apostrophizes the others with the above formula (probably substituting their real names for the words 'ambā,' &c.):--lepsam (? lipsāṁ) tāvad esha patnīvaktrakaḥ (? patnīvakirataḥ) prāpnoti, katham, ekaikā hi patnī itarās tisra āmantrya śeshāḥ paridevayamānā dr̥śyate, he ambe he ambike he ambālike yūyam apuṇyā nīshpādotv asya (?) samīpaṁ, sa ca pakshapātī kutsitosvako mayi yushmākaṁ sasasti meva (!) subhadrikāṁ kāmpīlavāsinīm ida (? iha) surūpāṁ na tu māṁ kaścit tatra nayatīti; sasastīty eva vartamānasāmīpye vartamānavad (Pāṇ. III, 3, 131) ity āsannasevane drashṭavyaḥ.--This barbarous ceremony was evidently an old indigenous custom too firmly established in popular practice to be easily excluded from the sacrificial ritual. That it had nothing to do with Vedic religion and was distasteful to the author of the Brāhmaṇa is evident from the brief way in which he refers to it, and from the far-fetched symbolic explanations attached to the formulas and discourses.

wives [^egg_820]: he thereby has called upon them (to come), and, indeed, also renders them sacrificially pure.

[^egg_820]: 322:1 Viz. from their ordinary place near the Gārhapatya he leads them whilst holding jars of water in their hands.

4. With (Vāj. S. XXIII, 19), 'We call upon thee, the host-leader of (divine) hosts, O my true lord!' the wives walk round (the horse), and thus make amends to it for that (slaughtering [^egg_821]): even thereby they (already) make amends to it; but,

[^egg_821]: 322:2 Apahnuvate vismaranty evāsmai etat pradakshiṇāvartanena saṁjñapanam unnayanti, comm.

indeed, they also fan [^egg_822] it. Thrice they walk round [^egg_823]; for three (in number) are these worlds: by means of these worlds they fan it. Thrice again they walk round [^egg_824],--that amounts to six, for there are six seasons: by means of the seasons they fan it.

[^egg_822]: 323:1 Thus Harisvāmin:--dhuvate dhūnane(na) upavājayanti, evam aśvaṁ rājānam iva vyajanair etat,--'they shake themselves,' St. Petersb. Dict.; and, indeed, it is doubtless by the flutter of the garments produced in walking round first one way and then another, that the fanning is supposed to be produced.

[^egg_823]: 323:2 Viz. in sunwise fashion (pradakshiṇā), that is so as to keep the object circumambulated on one's right side.

[^egg_824]: 323:3 Viz. in the opposite, the 'apradakshiṇaṁ' way, as is done in the sacrifice to the departed ancestors. They do so with the text, 'We call upon thee, the dear Lord of the dear ones, O my true lord!'

5. But, indeed, the vital airs depart from those who perform the fanning at the sacrifice. Nine times they walk round [^egg_825]; for there are nine vital airs: vital airs they thus put into their own selves, and the vital airs do not depart from them. 'I will urge the seed-layer, urge thou the seed-layer!' (the Mahishī says [^egg_826]);--seed, doubtless, means offspring and cattle: offspring and cattle she thus secures for herself. [Vāj. S. XXIII, 20,] 'Let us stretch our feet,' thus in order to secure union. 'In heaven ye envelop yourselves' (the Adhvaryu says),--for that is, indeed, heaven where they immolate the victim: therefore he

[^egg_825]: 323:4 Viz. another three times in the sunwise way. Having completed their circumambulation, the king's wives cleanse the horse's apertures of the vital airs (mouth, nostrils, eyes, &c.), as the Sacrificer's wife did at the ordinary animal sacrifice (III, 8, 2, 4), which they do with the text, 'We call upon thee, the treasure-lord of treasures, O my true lord!'

[^egg_826]: 323:5 Cf. III, 5, 2, 1 seqq.

speaks thus.--'May the vigorous male, the layer of seed, lay seed!' she says in order to secure union.
