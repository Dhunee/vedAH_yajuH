1. And as to why it is called Purushamedha:--The stronghold (pur) doubtless is these worlds, and the Purusha (spirit) is he that blows here (the wind), he bides (śī) in this stronghold (pur): hence he is the Purusha. And whatever food there is in these worlds that is its 'medha,' its food; and inasmuch as this is its 'medha,' its food, therefore (it is called) Purushamedha. And inasmuch as at this (sacrifice) he seizes [^fn_1059] men (purusha) meet for sacrifice (medhya), therefore also it is called Purushamedha.

[^fn_1059]: 407:1 That is, he (symbolically) immolates them.

## 02
2. He seizes them on the central day, for the central day is the air, and the air is the abode of all beings; and, indeed, these victims are also food, and the central day is the belly: he thus puts food in the belly.

## 03
3. He seizes them by decades [^fn_1060] for the obtainment

[^fn_1060]: 407:2 The statement in paragraphs 3 and 4, according to which there are eleven decades of human victims, does not refer to the actual distribution of victims over the eleven stakes, but it is apparently made purely for symbolical reasons (viz. with reference to the Virāj and Trishṭubh metres), and is probably based on the way in which the victims are enumerated in the Vājasaneyi-saṁhitā, XXX, 5-22 (see the Translation at the end of this chapter, where they are, however, numbered according to the stakes). There the first eleven Kaṇḍikās (5-15) are made up of the names and deities of ten victims each, hence together of eleven decades; whilst of the subsequent Kaṇḍikās--k. 16 consists of twelve, ks. 17-22 of ten each, and k. 22 of twelve victims. The actual mode of distribution over the several stakes is that referred to in paragraphs 5-8, viz. the first forty-eight victims are tied to the central stake, after which eleven victims are tied to each of the other ten stakes. After these, amounting to 258 victims, the Saṁhitā  enumerates twenty-six additional victims, which, according to Mahīdhara (cf. Kāty. XXI, 1, so), are to be added to the eleven victims of the second stake,--viz. fourteen victims dedicated to various so-called deities; eight victims, sacred to Prajāpati and belonging neither to the Śūdra nor to the Brāhmaṇa castes; and finally four more victims, characterised in exactly the same way as the eight preceding ones. It will be seen that of these twenty-six victims only the first set of (eight) Prājāpatya victims are referred to in the Brāhmaṇa, and that as the victims seized last of all. This circumstance clearly characterises the last four victims of the Saṁhitā as not recognised by the Brāhmaṇa; and seeing that all four of these are such as have already occurred amongst the previously enumerated victims (though there assigned to different divinities) they must be considered (as they are by Prof. Weber, Ind. Streifen, I, p. 68) as having been added to the list of the Saṁhitā subsequently to the composition of the Brāhmaṇa. A similar inference will probably apply to the fourteen victims preceding the eight Prājāpatya ones, though all that can be urged against them is that they are not referred to in the Brāhmaṇa.

of all food, for the Virāj consists of ten syllables, and the Virāj is all food [^fn_1061].

[^fn_1061]: 408:1 Hardly,--and all food is virāj (widely ruling or shining). In double clauses with a middle term, such as this, the position of subject and predicate seems often reversed in the second clause (cf. for instance, XIII, 8, 1, 4),

## 04
4. Eleven decades [^fn_1062] he seizes;--the Trishṭubh consists of eleven syllables, and the Trishṭubh is the thunderbolt, and vigour: with the thunderbolt, with vigour, the Sacrificer thus repels evil from within him.

[^fn_1062]: 408:2 See note 2 on p. 407.

## 05
5. Forty-eight he seizes at the central stake;--the Jagatī consists of forty-eight syllables, and cattle are of Jāgata (movable) nature: by means of the Jagatī he (the priest) secures cattle for him.

## 06
6. Eleven at each of the others;--the Trishṭubh consists of eleven syllables, and the Trishṭubh is the thunderbolt, and vigour: with the thunderbolt,

with vigour, the Sacrificer thus repels evil from about him.

## 07
7. Last of all he seizes eight;--the Gāyatrī consists of eight syllables, and the Gāyatrī is the Brahman (n.): he thus makes the Brahman to be the ultimate thing of this universe, whence they say that the Brahman is the ultimate thing of this universe.

## 08
8. These (eight) are sacred to Prajāpati, Prajāpati assuredly is the Brahman, for Prajāpati is of the nature of the Brahman [^fn_1063]: therefore they are sacred to Prajāpati.

[^fn_1063]: 409:1 That is, of the divine spirit, the world-soul, of which Prajāpati is, as it were, the personification, or phenomenal representative.

## 09
9. When about to bring up the victims, he offers those three oblations to Savitr̥, with (Vāj. S. XXX, 1-3), 'God Savitr̥, (speed the sacrifice, speed the lord of sacrifice unto his share)!'--'May we obtain that glorious light of the God Savitr̥, (who shall inspire our prayers)!'--'All troubles remove thou from us, O God Savitr̥: bestow unto us what is auspicious!' He thus pleases Savitr̥, and thus pleased with him, he (Savitr̥) impels (speeds) those (sacrificial) men, and he seizes them impelled by that (Savitr̥).

## 10
10. For the priesthood he seizes a Brāhmaṇa, for the Brāhmaṇa is the priesthood: he thus joins priesthood to priesthood [^fn_1064];--for the nobility he seizes a Rājanya, for the Rājanya is the nobility: he thus joins nobility to nobility;--for the Maruts (he seizes) a Vaiśya, for the Maruts are the clans (peasants): he thus joins peasantry to peasantry;--

[^fn_1064]: 409:2 Or, he perfects, completes, the priesthood by (adding to it a member of) the priesthood.

for (religious) toil (he seizes) a Śūdra, for the Śūdra is toil: he thus joins toil to toil;--according to their particular form he thus supplies these divinities with victims, and, thus supplied, they supply him with all his objects of desire.

## 11
11. He makes offering with ghee, for ghee is fiery mettle: by means of fiery mettle he thus endows him (the Sacrificer) with fiery mettle. He makes offering with ghee, for that--to wit, ghee--is the dear resource of the gods: he thus supplies them with their dear resource, and, thus supplied, they supply him with all his objects of desire.

## 12
12. By means of the Purusha Nārāyaṇa (litany), the Brahman priest (seated) to the right (south) of them, praises the men bound (to the stakes) with this sixteen-versed (hymn, R̥g-v. X, 90, Vāj. S. XXXI, 1-16), 'The thousand-headed Purusha, thousand-eyed, thousand-footed [^fn_1065] . . .;'--thus (he does) for the obtainment and the securing of everything, for everything here consists of sixteen parts, and the Purushamedha is everything: in thus saying, 'So and so thou art, so and so thou art,' he praises and thereby indeed magnifies him (Purusha); but he also thereby speaks of him, such as he is. Now, the victims had had the fire carried round them, but they were not yet slaughtered,--

[^fn_1065]: 410:1 For a complete translation of this hymn, the Purusha-sūkta, see J. Muir, Orig. Sanskrit Texts, vol. i, p. 9 seqq. Cp. also part iv, introduction, p. xiv.

## 13
13. Then a voice [^fn_1066] said to him, 'Purusha, do not

[^fn_1066]: 410:2 'A bodiless voice,' comm.; cf. XI, 4, 2, 16 where likewise 'an invisible voice' is introduced censuring the priest who burns the oblations. Perhaps, however, Vāc may be intended from whom Prajāpati, in the beginning, produced the waters; cf. VI, 1, 1, 9.

consummate (these human victims [^fn_1067]): if thou wert to consummate them, man (purusha) would eat man.' Accordingly, as soon as fire had been carried round them, he set them free, and offered oblations to the same divinities [^fn_1068], and thereby gratified those divinities, and, thus gratified, they, gratified him with all objects of desire.

[^fn_1067]: 411:1 Thus (i.e. do not go through with this human sacrifice) the commentator, probably correctly, interprets 'saṁsthāpaya' (instead of 'do not kill,' St. Petersb. Dict., though, practically, it would, of course, come to the same thing),--Purusha, etān purushapaśūn mā saṁtishṭipaḥ, udaṅnayādikāny aṅgāny eshāṁ mā kr̥thā ityarthaḥ; yadi saṁsthāpayishyasi tataḥ śeshabhakshānukāreṇa lokepi purushaḥ purusham bhakshayishyati tac cāyuktam ity abhiprāyaḥ. In the same way the verse ought accordingly to have been translated in III, 7, 2, 8.

[^fn_1068]: 411:2 That is, he offers with the formulas 'To the Brahman, hail! to the Kshatra, hail! &c., running through the whole series of so-called divinities of the released victims.

## 14
14. He makes offering with ghee, for ghee is fiery mettle: with fiery mettle he thus bestows fiery mettle upon him.

## 15
15. He concludes with those of the set of eleven (stakes),--the Trishṭubh consists of eleven syllables, and the Trishṭubh is the thunderbolt, and vigour: with the thunderbolt, with vigour, the Sacrificer thus repels evil from within.

## 16
16. The Udayanīyā (concluding oblation) having been completed, he seizes eleven barren cows, sacred to Mitra-Varuṇa, the Viśve Devāḥ, and Br̥haspati [^fn_1069], with the view of winning these deities. And as to those of Br̥haspati being last,--Br̥haspati truly is the Brahman (n.), and thus he finally establishes himself in the Brahman.

[^fn_1069]: 411:3 Viz. three for each of the first two deities, and five for Br̥haspati.

## 17
17. And as to why there are eleven of them,--the Trishṭubh consists of eleven syllables, and the Trishṭubh is the thunderbolt, and vigour: with the thunderbolt, with vigour, the Sacrificer thus repels evil from within. The Traidhātavī is the final offering (Udavasānīyā): the mystic import is the same (as before [^fn_1070]).

[^fn_1070]: 412:1 Viz. as set forth V, 5, 5, 6 seqq.

## 18
18. Now as to the sacrificial fees. What there is towards the middle of the kingdom other than the land and the property of the Brāhmaṇa, but including the men, of that the eastern quarter belongs to the Hotr̥, the southern to the Brahman, the western to the Adhvaryu, and the northern to the Udgātr̥; and the Hotr̥kas share this along with them.

## 19
19. And if a Brāhmaṇa performs the sacrifice, he should bestow all his property in order to obtain and secure everything, for the Brāhmaṇa is everything, and all one's property is everything, and the Purushamedha is everything.

## 20
20. And having taken up the two fires within his own self [^fn_1071], and worshipped the sun with the Uttara-Nārāyaṇa (litany, viz. Vāj. S. XXXI, 17-22), let him betake himself to the forest without looking round; and that (place), indeed, is apart from men. But should he wish to live in the village, let him take up again the two fires in the churning-sticks, and having worshipped the sun with the Uttara-Nārāyaṇa (litany) let him dwell at his home, and let him offer such sacrifices as he may

[^fn_1071]: 412:2 Viz. by thrice inhaling the heat (or smoke) emitted by the fires, Cf. Mānava-Dh. VI, 38; Baudhāyana-Dharmas. II, 17, 26.

be able to afford. But, indeed, this (sacrifice) is not to be imparted to any and every one, lest one should impart everything to any and every one, for the Purushamedha is everything; but one may only impart it to one who is known to him, and who is versed in sacred writ, and who may be dear to him, but not to any and every one.

[^fn_1078]: 414:4 The meaning of 'utsāda' is doubtful; it might be 'removal,' only the etymological meaning of 'ut-sad' having probably suggested the combination.

[^fn_1079]: 414:5 Mahīdhara takes 'srāma' in the sense of one affected with ophthalmia (cf. srāva): in both senses the association of ideas is intelligible, though apparently (as in other cases) of a jocular nature.
