1. Verily, they who sit (sacrificing) for a year, by means of six months go to him that burns yonder:

so it is told on the part of the Sāman, in as much as it is made of the form of that (sun) it is told on the part of the R̥k [^fn_989]; and now in like manner on the part of the Yajus, by means of preparatory rite, when they draw that (graha) [^fn_990], they thereby also go to him (the sun).

[^fn_989]: 427:1 Ta etaṁ shaḍbhir māsair yanti, tasmāt parāñco grahā gr̥hyante parāñci stotrāṇi parāñci śastrāṇi. Ta etaṁ shashṭḥe māse gacḥanti tad etasya rūpaṁ kriyate. Kāṇva text.

[^fn_990]: 427:2 Viz. the Atigrāhya cup to Sūrya (IV, 5, 4, 2 seq.), which has  to be drawn on the Vishuvant or middle day of the Gavām ayana; an animal sacrifice to the same deity being also prescribed.

[^fn_991]: 428:1 The Kāṇva text allows the alternative mantra, Rig-veda I, 50, 3; Vāj. S. VIII, 40, Adr̥śram asya ketavaḥ, &c. See IV, 5, 4, 11.
