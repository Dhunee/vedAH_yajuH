1. Having drawn the cups of Soma, and gone out (of the cart-shed to the high altar) [^egg_733], he offers the oblation of drops [^egg_734]. The reason why he offers the oblation of drops is this. Whatever drops of that (Soma) are spilt here, to them he now wishes a safe journey to the Āhavanīya, for the Āhavanīya is the resting-place of offerings: this is why he offers the oblation of drops.

[^egg_733]: 305:1 The libations (grahas) having been taken, and the remaining Nigrābhyā water, mixed with Soma-juice, poured from the Hotr̥'s cup into the Droṇakalaśa (p. 256, note 1), the Adhvaryu, Pratiprasthātr̥; Prastotr̥, Udgātr̥, Pratihartr̥, and Sacrificer walk out of the Havirdhāna shed, each following one touching the hem of the garment of the one before him, and betake themselves to the altar.

[^egg_734]: 305:2 The vipruḍ-homa, an expiatory oblation for the Soma spilt during the pressing, consists of a pracaranī spoon full of ghee. According to Āśv. V, 2, 6, and Lāṭy. I, 11, 9, it would seem that each of those taking part in the Sarpaṇa (see p. 299, note 2) makes two oblations (called 'pravr̥tta-homa' by Lāṭy. Sr. and Pañcaviṁśa Br.).

2. He offers with (Vāj. S. VII, 26; Rig-veda X, 17, 12), 'Whatever drop of thine leapeth

away, whatever stalk of thine,'--whatever particle (of Soma) is spilt, that is a drop, that indeed he means; and by 'whatever stalk of thine' he mentions the stalk;--'stone-pressed, from the lap of the press-bowls;' for pressed by the stone [^egg_735] it leaps away from the two press-bowls;--'be it from the Adhvaryu or from the strainer,'--for it leaps away either from the Adhvaryu's hands or from the strainer,--'that I offer unto thee in my mind consecrated by Vashaṭ, Hail!' whereby it becomes for him as an offering consecrated by Vashaṭ.

[^egg_735]: 306:1 'Grāva-cyuta' seems to be taken by the author in the sense of set in motion by the (pressing) stone.' The Rig-veda reads 'bāhu-cyuta;' also 'dhishaṇāyāḥ' instead of 'dhishaṇayoḥ.'

3. Thereupon the Adhvaryu takes two stalks of grass from the covered altar. The two Adhvaryus [^egg_736] proceed first (to the chanting-place beside the pit), as the out-breathing and in-breathing of the sacrifice; then the Prastotr̥, as the voice of the sacrifice; then the Udgātr̥, as the self (or body), the Prajāpati, of the sacrifice; then the Pratihartr̥, either as the physician or the through-breathing [^egg_737].

[^egg_736]: 306:2 That is, the Adhvaryu and his assistant, the Pratiprasthātr̥.

[^egg_737]: 306:3 Ait. Br. II, 20 enumerates Adhvaryu, Prastotr̥; Pratihartr̥; Udgātr̥, and Brahman (see also Āśv. V, 2, 4-5); the Lāṭyāy. Sūtra I, 11, Adhvaryu, Prastotr̥, Udgātr̥; Pratihartr̥, Brahman, and Sacrificer.

4. The Sacrificer holds on to those five priests from behind [^egg_738], for as much as those five priests are, so much is the whole sacrifice, the sacrifice being fivefold: hence the Sacrificer thereby holds on to the sacrifice.

5. He (the Adhvaryu) then throws one of the two

stalks of grass forward towards the pit [^egg_739], with, 'Thou art the ascent of the gods!' for when the gods through the sacrifice attained to the heavenly world, it was from that pit that they went upwards to the heavenly world: he thus makes the sacrificer look along the road to heaven.

[^egg_739]: 307:1 The Udgātr̥s (chanters) also throw stalks of grass to the south with their left hands, with the text, Pañcav. I, 3, 3.

6. He then throws down the other stalk in front of the chanters, silently, for those chanters represent the hymn of praise (stotra), Prajāpati (the sacrifice),--he (Prajāpati) draws to himself everything here, and takes possession of everything here: it is to him that that stalk is offered, and thus he does not draw the Adhvaryu to himself, and take possession of him. And when they mutter [^egg_740],--for the chanters mutter now [^egg_741],--

[^egg_740]: 307:2 And when he thinks 'they have muttered' (atha yadā manyate ’jāpishur iti)--for the chanters mutter now. Kāṇva text.

[^egg_741]: 307:3 For the mantras the Udgātr̥s have to mutter on this occasion, previous to the chanting, see Tāṇḍya Br. I, 3, 4-6. The recitation of the Ājyaśastra, by the Hotr̥, succeeding the chanting of the Bahishpavamāna-stotra, is likewise preceded by a prayer muttered by that priest, for which see Ait. Br. II, 38; Āśv. V, 9.

[^egg_743]: 307:5 The first stotra at each pressing is called pavamāna (purifying, i.e. during the chanting of which the Soma becomes clarified), viz. the Bahishpavamāna at the morning, the Mādhyandina pavamāna at the midday, and the Ārbhava (or tr̥tīya) pavamāna at the evening pressing. The other stotras are called Dhurya, 'to be harnessed, belonging to or forming a team.' For the correspondence between the stotra and śastra, see p. 325, note 2.

8. With 'Turn ye back [^egg_744]!' (he bespeaks) the other chants (viz. the Dhuryas), and turning back (or repeating) they chant the Dhuryas [^egg_745], for the latter

[^egg_744]: 308:1 This is Sāyaṇa's interpretation of 'upāvartadhvam,' instead of 'draw near,' as translated by me at I, 5, 2, 12. He is probably right in connecting it with the repetitions which certain verses have to undergo in the dhurya-stotras.

[^egg_745]: 308:2 There are many different stomas, or forms of chanting stotras, named from the number of verses produced in each form (generally by repetitions of certain verses). Those required for the Shaḍaha and Dvādaśāha (see IV, 5, 4, 1 seq.) are: trivr̥t (9), pañcadaśa (15), saptadaśa 07), ekaviṁśa (21), triṇava (27), trayastriṁśa (33), caturviṁśa (24), catuścatvāriṁśa (44), and ashtacatvāriṁśa (48). The first four of these are those most frequently used, and the only ones used at the Agnishṭoma. All these stomas, with one exception (24), have two or more different varieties or arrangements, called vishṭuti, differing from one another either in the order in which the several verses are to be chanted, or in regard to the number of repetitions which the corresponding verses have to undergo. Besides, stomas are generally performed in three turns or rounds, paryāya, consisting of a triplet of verses (some of which may have to be repeated more than once), and preceded by the sound 'huṁ' (Hiṅkāra). Thus the first Ājyastotra, Sāmav. II, 10-12, (consisting of three verses, a, b, c,) is to be performed in the pañcadaśa-stoma; that is, the three verses have to be so treated, by repetitions, as to produce fifteen verses in three turns. Now, as there are three different varieties of performing the pañcadaśa-stoma, the stotra might be chanted in one or other of the following three arrangements:--

10. The Bahishpavamāna [^egg_747] chant truly is a ship

[^egg_747]: 310:1 The Bahishpavamāna-(stotra), or 'outside-pavamāna,'--so called because (on the first day of a Soma-sacrifice) it is performed outside the altar (commentary on Pañcav. Br. VI, 8, 10-11; or outside the Sadas, Sāy. on Sāmav. S. p. 47),--is chanted in the Trivr̥t, or threefold, stoma; consisting, as it does, of three gāyatrī triplets (Sāmav. II, 1-9 for the Agnishṭoma), and none of its verses being chanted more than once. This stoma has three different varieties, viz. the udyatī, or ascending mode, the first turn of which consists of the first verses of the three triplets, the second turn of the second verses, and the third turn of the last verses, hence a1 a2 a3--b1 b2 b3--c1 c2 c3; the parivartinī, or reverting mode, following the natural order, a1 b1 c1--a2 b2 c2--a3 b3 c3; and the kulāyinī, or web-like mode, performed in the order a1 b1 c1-b2 c2 a2--c3 a3 b3. Cf. Haug, Transl. Ait. Br. p. 237, where, however, these forms are described quite differently. The term used for the natural order of verses in the parivartinī vishṭuti is 'parācī,' i.e. thitherwards, straight off. From the statement in paragraph 7 above, that 'they chant straight off (parāk),' one might therefore infer that that particular mode of chanting ought to be used for the Bahishpavamāna-stotra; but the term 'parāk' may also be taken as referring to each of the several verses being chanted 'straight off,' without any repetition. Haug, Transl. Ait. Br. p. 120 note, remarks: 'Each of these verses is for the purpose of chanting divided into four parts: Praśṭāva, i, e. prelude, the first being preceded by ḥuṁ̃, to be sung by the Prastotar; Uḍjīṭḥa, the principal part of the Sāman, preceded by Oṁ, to be chanted by the Udgātar; the Praṭiḥāra, i.e. response [? rather check, stop; cf. IV, 3, 4, 22], introduced by ḥuṁ̃, to be chanted by the Pratihartar; and the Ṇiḍḥaṇa, i.e. finale, to be sung by all three. To give the student an idea of this division, I here subjoin the second of these r̥cas in the Sāman form, distinguishing its four parts:--

bound heavenwards: the priests are its spars and oars, the means of reaching the heavenly world. If there be a blameworthy one, even that one (priest) would make it sink: he makes it sink, even as one who ascends a ship that is full would make it sink. And, indeed, every sacrifice is a ship bound heavenwards: hence one should seek to keep a blameworthy (priest) away from every sacrifice.

11. Thereupon, when the chanting is over [^egg_748], he

[^egg_748]: 311:1 Lāṭy. I, 12; II, 1; Tāṇḍya Br. VI, 7 seq. give the following details: The Prastotr̥ takes the prastara (bunch of grass, representing the Sacrificer) from the Adhvaryu and says, 'Brahman, we will chant, O Praśāstar!' The Brahman and Maitrāvaruṇa having given their assent (Āśv. V, 2, 12-14). the Prastotr̥ hands the prastara to the Udgātr̥. The latter touches his right thigh with it (or bends his right knee thereon) and 'harnesses' (introduces) the chant by the formula, 'with Agni's fire, with Indra's might, with Sūrya's brilliance, may Br̥haspati harness thee,' &c. (Tāṇḍya Br. I, 3, 5); whereupon he mutters, 'I will make food,' &c. (ib. 6); and after looking towards the pit and a vessel of water and the sun. he commences the chant. The three chanters are seated west of the Adhvaryu and Pratiprasthātr̥ (who look towards them), viz. the Udgātr̥ facing the north, the Prastotr̥ the west, and the Pratihartr̥ the south (or south-east). To the west of them are seated three, four, or six subordinate singers, or choristers (upagātr̥), who accompany the chanting in a deep voice with the sound 'Ho.' When the chant is completed, the Udgātr̥ says, 'I have made food,' and makes the sacrificer mutter the formula, 'Thou art a falcon,' &c. (Pañc. Br. I, 3, 8); whereupon he takes a stalk of grass from the prastara, cuts off the top and bottom, so as to make it of the length of four thumbs’ breadths, and throws it into the pit with, 'If it has been chanted,' &c. (ib. II, 1, 8). They then pour out the vessel of water into the pit, with, 'I send you to the sea,' &c., and make 3, 5, 7 or 9 steps northwards outside the altar,  whereupon they betake themselves to the Āgnīdhrīya. During the chanting, the Unnetr̥ pours the Soma-juice from the Ādhavanīya trough through the strainer into the Pūtabhr̥t.

utters this speech,--'Agnīdh, spread the fires! strew the barhis! Prepare the cakes! go on with the victim!' The Agnīdh spreads the fires, that is to say, kindles them [^egg_749]; he strews that barhis [^egg_750], thinking, 'When the barhis is strewn, I will offer to the gods on the kindled (fire).'--'Prepare the cakes,' he says, because he is about to proceed with the cakes; and, 'Go on with the victim,' because he is about to get ready the victim [^egg_751].

[^egg_749]: 312:1 The Agnīdh takes burning coals from the Āgnīdhrīya fire, and puts them on the dhishṇya hearths, in the order in which they were raised. See p. 148, note 4.

[^egg_750]: 312:2 He spreads a layer of (ulapa) grass along the 'spine' (the line from the middle of the back to the middle of the front side) of the altar.

[^egg_752]: 312:4 Having taken this cup of Soma or libation (with the formula, Vāj. S. VII, 11) from the Droṇa-kalaśa or the Pūtabhr̥t, he makes the sacrificer eye the several cups and Soma vessels, as set forth IV, 5, 6, 1 seq.; the Āśvina being looked at sixth in order (or fourth of the grahas), not tenth (as was its order of drawing).

14. Let him therefore, at the Agnishṭoma, slay a (victim) sacred to Agni, for there is harmony when, at the Agnishṭoma, he slays a (victim) for Agni. If

it be an Ukthya sacrifice, let him slay one to Indra and Agni in the second place, for songs of praise (uktha) [^egg_754] refer to Indra and Agni. If it be a Shoḍaśin sacrifice, let him slay one to Indra in the third place, for the sixteenfold chant (shoḍaśin) [^egg_755] means Indra. If it be an Atirātra, let him slay one to Sarasvatī in the fourth place, for Sarasvatī is speech, and speech (vāc, fem.) is female, as the night (rātri, fem.) is female: he thus duly distinguishes the forms of sacrifice [^egg_756].

[^egg_754]: 313:1 Or, the (three) Uktha-stotras (Sāmav. II, 55-62) and śastras, the characteristic feature of the Ukthya sacrifice. Cf. p. 325, note ; and IV, 6, 3, 3.

[^egg_755]: 313:2 The Shoḍaśi-stotra (Sāmav. II, 302-304) chanted in the ekaviṁśa stoma is the characteristic stotra of the Shoḍaśin sacrifice. The term meaning 'having a sixteenth' (viz. stotra), it evidently refers originally to the sacrifice, and has then also been applied to the stotra and śastra. See also Haug, Ait. Br. Transl. p. 255, note 2.

[^egg_756]: 313:3 On this occasion the same rites are performed as at the sacrifice of the Agnīshomīya buck (III, 6, 4, 1 seq.), viz. from the girding of the stake (III, 7, 1, 19) to the election of the Hotr̥ (III, 7, 4, 9). Then the other priests are elected, viz. Adhvaryu (and Pratiprasthātr̥), the Praśāstr̥ (Maitrāvaruṇa), the Brāhmaṇācḥaṁsin, the Potr̥, the Neshṭr̥, the Āgnīdhra, and finally the sacrificer himself; after which each of them makes two election oblations (pravr̥tahoma) of ghee, the first with, 'May I be well-pleasing to Speech, well-pleasing to the Lord of speech: O divine Speech, what sweetest, most pleasing speech is thine, therewith endow me! Hail to Sarasvatī!' the second with, 'May the holy Sarasvatī, of abundant powers, rich in devotion, accept favourably our sacrifice!' Thereupon they proceed with the animal offering up to the offering of the omentum (vapā) and cleansing (III, 8, 2, 30); after which all the eighteen priests and the sacrificer perform the Sarpaṇa (see p. 299, note 2), that is, they step up to the eight dhishṇya hearths (with formulas Vāj. S. V, 31 a-d; 32 a-d respectively), the Adhvaryu then pointing out the Āhavanīya, the Bahishpavamāna place, the Cātvāla, &c. (with Vāj. S. V, 32 e seq.); and touching the Sadas and its door-posts, and addressing Sūrya (the sun), the R̥tvijs (officiating priests) and dhishṇya hearths (with V, 33-34). Kāty. IX, 8, 8-25.
