[^egg_774]: 325:2 Every chant or hymn (stotra) of the Udgātr̥s is followed by a 'song of praise' (śastra) recited by the Hotr̥ or one of his three assistants (Maitrāvaruṇa, Brāhmaṇācḥaṁsin, and Acḥāvāka); the first two śastras at each savana being recited by the Hotr̥, and the three additional ones at the morning and midday feast by his assistants (Hotrakas). The exact correlation between the stotras and śastras at the three savanas will appear from the following table:--

 Adhvaryu responds (prati-ā-gar), whence the name response (pratigara).

2. [The Hotr̥] calls upon that (Adhvaryu) seated (before him) with his face towards the east [^egg_775]. For all

[^egg_775]: 326:1 While the Adhvaryu sits before the Sadas, with his back to the Hotr̥ (p. 322, note 1), the latter performs the (tūshṇīm-) japa--i.e. the muttering of the formula 'May Father Mātariśvan grant flawless (verse-) feet! may the bards sing flawless hymns!' &c. Ait. Br. II, 38; Āśv. Śr. V, 9, 1--after which he addresses to the Adhvaryu his call (āhāva), 'śõṁsāvõm (let us two recite, Om)!'--which formula is used at all śastras, except that, at the midday and evening libations, it is preceded by 'Adhvaryo' (O Adhvaryu); while at the evening savana the first syllable of the verb is repeated, thus 'śośoṁsāvo.'--The Adhvaryu rises, turns round so as to face the Hotr̥, and responds by 'śoṁsāmo daiva (we recite, O divine one)!' According to Ait. Br. III, 12, the Āhāva and Pratigara together are to consist of the number of syllables corresponding to the metre of the respective libation, viz. 8, 11, 12 respectively. Then follows the Hotr̥s Tūshṇīṁ-śaṁsa or 'silent praise;' viz. 'Earth! Agni is the light, the light is Agni, Om!--Indra is the light, Ether! the light is Indra, Om! Sūrya is the light, the light, Heaven! is Sūrya, Om!'--This is followed by a Puroruc, or preliminary invocation of a deity, recited in a loud voice, (and consisting of twelve short formulas resembling the Nivid part i, p. 114, note 2; ib. I, 4, 2, 5 seq.), which, indeed, takes its place in the śastras of the midday and evening libations, being inserted in the middle or before the last verse of the hymn of the śastra; viz. Agni kindled by the gods, Agni kindled by man, Agni the well-kindling, the Hotr̥ chosen by the gods, the Hotr̥ chosen by men, the carrier of offerings, the leader of sacrifices, the irresistible Hotr̥, the swift carrier of oblations: may he, the god,  bring hither the gods! may Agni, the god, worship the gods! may (Agni), the knower of beings, perform the sacrificial rites!' (Ait. Br. II, 34.) Then follows the hymn, the Ājya-sūkta, the chief part of the śastra, viz. Rig-veda III, 13, 'To him, your god Agni, will I sing with loudest voice; may he come hither to us with the gods; may he, the best offerer, sit down on our sacred grass!' &c.; the seven (anushṭubh) verses of which are recited in the order 1, 5, 4, 6, 3, 2, 7. The first and last verses being, however, repeated thrice, the number is thus raised to eleven. The recitation of the hymn is followed by the so-called ukthavīrya ('the strength of the praise'), consisting of the formula ukthaṁ vāci, 'praise hath been sung,' with some words added to it differing at different śastras,--at the present śastra 'ghoshāya tvā,' 'thee (I have recited) for sound (praise)!' [for school-differences as to these formulas, see Haug, Transl. Ait. Br. p. 177],--to which the Adhvaryu responds, 'Om ukthasāḥ,' 'yea, singer of praise!' The Ukthavīrya, together with the response, is again to consist of as many syllables as the characteristic metre of the respective libation. Then follows the recitation, by the Āgnīdhra (Ait. Br. VI, 14), of the yājyā or offering prayer, viz. Rig-veda III, 25, 4.--As regards the term 'ājya,' the Pañc. Br. VII, 2, 1, 2, derives it from āji, a race, in accordance with the following legend: When Prajāpati offered himself as a sacrifice to the gods, the latter could not agree as to which of them should have the first share. Prajāpati then proposed that they should run a race for it. In this race Agni came off first, then Mitravaruna, then Indra. To each of these three divinities an ājya was thereupon assigned; and, by a secret understanding between Indra and Agni, these two divided the fourth ājya between them. Hence the āgneya, maitrāvaruṇa, aindra, and aindrāgna śastra (and stotra), belonging to the Hotr̥, Maitrāvaruṇa, Brāhmaṇācḥaṁsin, and Acḥāvāka priests respectively.

others except the Udgātr̥ perform their priestly duties while facing the east, and in this manner that priestly duty of his is performed towards the east.

3. Now the Udgātr̥ is Prajāpati, and the Hotr̥, (being) the R̥k (fem.), is a female. And when he chants, then the Udgātr̥, Prajāpati, implants seed in the female Hotr̥, the R̥k; this the Hotr̥ brings forth by means of the śastra (recitation), he sharpens

it even as this man is sharpened [^egg_776], and because he thereby sharpens (śo) therefore it is called sastra.

[^egg_776]: 328:1 That is, fashions him, or makes him slender. A fanciful derivation of śastra (śaṁs, to recite, praise, cf. carmen), from the root śā (śo), to sharpen (? or from śas, to cut, carve). 'Yathāyam purovartī purushas tīkshṇakr̥taḥ, avaya(va)vibhāgena spashṭīkr̥tas tathā śastreṇaitad retaḥ śyati spashṭaṁ karoti,' Sāy.

4. Having turned round (so as to face the Hotr̥, the Adhvaryu) then responds: thereby he quickens [^egg_777] that implanted seed. On the other hand, were he to respond while standing with his face turned away (from the Hotr̥), that implanted seed would assuredly perish away, and would not be brought forth; but thus facing each other (the male and female) bring forth the implanted seed.

5. Now the strength of the metres was exhausted by the gods, for it was by the metres that the gods attained the world of heaven. And the response (song) is ecstasy (mada [^egg_778])--what ecstasy there is in the r̥c and that which there is in the Sāman, that is sap: this sap he now lays into the metres, and thus makes the metres of restored strength; and with them of restored strength they perform the sacrifice.

6. Hence if (the Hotr̥) recites by half-verses, let (the Adhvaryu) respond at each half-verse; and if he recites by pādas (hemistichs), let him respond at each pāda. For whenever, in reciting, he (the Hotr̥) draws breath, there the Asura-Rakshas rush into the sacrifice: there he (the Adhvaryu) closes it up by means of the response, so that the evil spirits, the Rakshas, cannot rush in; and thus he destroys the world of the sacrificer's enemies.

7. Now, in the beginning the metres consisted of four syllables. Then Jagatī flew up for Soma and came back, leaving behind three syllables. Then Trishṭubh flew up for Soma and came back, leaving behind one syllable. Then Gāyatrī flew up for Soma, and she came back bringing with her those syllables as well as Soma. Thus she came to consist of eight syllables: wherefore they say, 'Gāyatrī is octosyllabic.'

8. With her they performed the morning feast of the Soma-sacrifice,--whence the morning feast pertains to Gāyatrī. With her they performed the midday feast. Trishṭubh then said to her, 'To thee will I come with three syllables: invite me, and exclude me not from the sacrifice!'--'So be it!' she said and invited her. Thus the Trishṭubh came to consist of eleven syllables, and therefore they say, 'The midday Soma feast pertains to Trishṭubh.'

9. With her (Gāyatrī) indeed they performed the evening feast. Jagatī then said to her, 'To thee will I come with one syllable: invite me, and exclude me not from the sacrifice!'--'So be it!' she said and invited her. Thus the Jagatī came to consist of twelve syllables; and therefore they say, 'The evening Soma feast pertains to Jagatī.'

10. As to this they say, 'Surely all the Soma feasts pertain to Gāyatrī, since Gāyatrī alone went on increasing.' At the morning feast he should therefore respond with a complete (formula), for complete [^egg_779] Gāyatrī returned. At the midday feast

[^egg_779]: 329:1 Or perhaps, successful, saṁsiddhā [svakīyāny aksharāṇy aparityajyāvikr̥tā (? avikr̥ttā), Sāy.]. The response (pratigara) here alluded to, is probably the one ordinarily used by the Adhvaryu, whenever the Hotr̥ pauses in his recitation, at the end of half-verses  (or pādas), nivids, &c., viz. 'Othamo daiva,'--or, Othāvo daivom, whenever the Hotr̥ puts in the sacred syllable 'om.' 'Tasmāt kāraṇād gāyatra-prātaḥsavane saṁsiddham avikr̥taṁ vidhāsyamānam omantam prati-gr̥hṇīyāt,' Sāy. For the Adhvaryu's response, 'śaṁsāmo daiva,' to the Hotr̥'s summons (āhāva), see p. 326, note 1.

 (he responds with a formula) containing once (the verb) 'to rejoice (mad) [^egg_780],' for she (Trishṭubh) came back, leaving one syllable behind; and with that same (formula) he then completes her, makes her whole,

[^egg_780]: 330:1 When the first verse of the trishṭubh hymn, Rig-veda X, 73, is recited by the Hotr̥ in the Marutvatīya Sastra at the midday feast, the Adhvaryu's response is 'madāmo daiva' (we rejoice, O divine one). Kāty. X, 3, 8; cf. Weber, Ind. Stud. X, p. 37.

11. When trishṭubh verses were recited. At the evening Soma feast (the Adhvaryu responds with a formula) containing thrice (the verb) 'to rejoice [^egg_781],' for she (Jagatī) came back leaving three syllables behind; and with these (formulas) he then completes her, makes her whole,--

[^egg_781]: 330:2 According to Kāty. X, 6, 6 'madāmo daiva' is optionally the Adhvaryu's response at the recitation in the Āgnimārutra Śastra of three of the so-called Anupānīya (or Svādushkilīya) trishṭubh verses VI, 47, 1-4 (see note on IV, 4, 2, 18). Possibly the present paragraph may refer to those verses, in which case the words 'when trishṭubh verses are recited' would begin a fresh paragraph. Sāyaṇa, however, seems to take it in the same way as above; cf. also the Kāṇva reading in next note.

12. When (the hymn) to Heaven and Earth is recited [^egg_782]. Now these creatures subsist on those two,

[^egg_782]: 330:3 This is the (Jagatī) hymn I, 159 recited in the Vaiśvadeva Sastra. According to Kāty. X, 6, 5, the response is to be thrice (after each of the three first verses) 'madāmo daiva.' The Kāṇva has for paragraphs 10-12, 'At the morning feast he responds by a complete (formula), for complete Gāyatrī returned. At the midday feast he responds once with one containing "mad," when he  recites trishṭubh verses, for she (Trishṭubh) returned leaving one syllable behind: hereby now he completes her, makes her whole. At the evening feast with something containing thrice "mad," for she (Jagatī) returned leaving three syllables behind: hereby now he completes her, makes her whole. At the (hymn) to Heaven and Earth he responds with one that contains "mad;" when he recites (the hymn) Heaven and Earth--these creatures subsisting on those two, Heaven and Earth--he thereby puts juice into them, and upon those two, thus rendered juiceful, these creatures subsist. He responds with "Om," for that is truth, that the gods know.'

13. Now some respond with 'Othāmo daiva vāk,' saying, 'The response is speech (vāk): thus we obtain speech.' But let him not do this; for surely, in whichsoever way he may respond, speech is obtained by him, since he responds by speech. Let him therefore respond with 'Om [^egg_783]!' only, for that is truth, that the gods know.

[^egg_783]: 331:1 That is, instead of 'vāk,' hence 'Othāmo daivom.' 'Om' pure and simple is the response at the end of the śastra.
