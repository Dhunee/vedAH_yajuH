## 05
5. 'To Agni hail!'--Agni, doubtless, is the self of all the gods: it is thus by means of all the deities that he heals whatever has been unsuccessful in the sacrifice.

## 22
22. The Pravargya, indeed, is the year; for the year is everything, and the Pravargya is everything: when it is placed on the fire then it is spring; when it is burning-hot then it is summer; when it is flowing over then it is the rainy season;--but, indeed, when the rains overflow, all the gods and all beings subsist thereon; and, verily, the rains overflow for him who thus knows this.

## 26

The Pravargya, indeed, is the Agnihotra, for the Agnihotra is everything, and the Pravargya is everything: when it (the Agnihotra milk) is put on the fire then it is the (Gharma) placed thereon; when it is ladled out then it is the burning-hot (Gharma); and when it is offered then it is the overflowing (Gharma);--but, indeed, when the Agnihotra overflows all the gods and all beings subsist thereon; and, verily, the Agnihotra overflows for him who thus knows this.
