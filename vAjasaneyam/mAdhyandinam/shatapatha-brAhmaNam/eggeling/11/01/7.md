2. If he eats cultivated plants he eats the sacrificial essence of the offering-cake; and if he eats forest plants he eats the essence of the barhis [^egg_116]; and if he eats aught of trees he eats the essence of the fuel (for the sacrificial fire); and if he drinks milk he consumes the essence of the Sānnāyya [^egg_117]; and if he drinks water he consumes the essence of the lustral waters [^egg_118]; and if he eats nothing he becomes consecrated to the Fathers.
