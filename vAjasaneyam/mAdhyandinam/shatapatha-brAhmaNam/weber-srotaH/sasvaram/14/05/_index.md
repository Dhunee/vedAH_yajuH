For the three वंश-s I have made use of the ऋषितर्पण (R.) in Chambers 736 (see my Verzeichnifs der Berliner Sanscrit-Handschriften nro. 206. p. 46.): though the accents are not given in the ms., the little work is still of some importance as confirming the readings themselves and moreover as showing the importance attached in later times to the वंश-s, whose recital is here forming even a part of the ritual, and the care taken by the ब्राह्मण-s to preserve them with their original readings.
