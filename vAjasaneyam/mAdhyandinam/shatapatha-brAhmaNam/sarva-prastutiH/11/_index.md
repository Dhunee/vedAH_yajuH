What regards the edition of this kâṇḍa and the next following two I am greatly indebted to the liberality of the Imperial Government of France, which enabled me to collate here in Berlin during summer 1854 three mss. belonging to the Imperial library of Paris (= P), viz. D. 146 for the eleventh, D. 159 for the twelfth, and D. 160 for the thirteenth kâṇḍa.
