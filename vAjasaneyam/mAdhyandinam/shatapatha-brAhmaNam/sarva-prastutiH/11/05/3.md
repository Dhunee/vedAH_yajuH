1. Śauceya Prācīnayogya came to Uddālaka Āruṇi for a disputation on spiritual matters [^egg_268], thinking, 'I desire to know the Agnihotra.'

[^egg_268]: 79:3 Sāyaṇa takes 'brahmodyam agnihotram' together, in the sense 'the sacred truth' regarding (or, in the form of) the Agnihotra,--agnihotravishayaṁ brahmodyaṁ brahmatattvasya rūpaṁ pratipādyate yena tad vividishāmi tadvishayaṁ vedaneccḥāṁ karishyāmītyādinābhiprāyeṇāgataḥ. Unless 'brahmodyam' could be taken as an adjective, I do not see how it is possible to adopt Sāyaṇa's interpretation.

[^egg_271]: 80:2 Whilst taking the oblation to the Āhavanīya, he holds the spoon level with his mouth, except when he is in a line between the two fires, when for a moment he lowers the spoon so as to be level with his navel.

[^egg_272]: 80:3 This refers to the putting down of the spoon containing the milk on the grass-bunch prior to the second libation; cf. II, 3, 1, 17. One might also translate, 'what is that (or does it mean) that thou didst put it down?'
