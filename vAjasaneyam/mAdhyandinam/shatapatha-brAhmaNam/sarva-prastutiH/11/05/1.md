1. The nymph Urvaśī loved Purūravas [^egg_228], the son of Iḍā. When she wedded him, she said,

[^egg_228]: 68:3 King Purūravas, of the lunar race of kings, is considered the  son of Budha (the planet Mercury, and son of Soma). On this myth (based on the hymn R̥g-veda S. X, 95) see Prof. Max Müller, Oxford Essays (1856), p. 61 seqq.; (reprinted in Chips from a German Workshop, II, p. 102 seqq.); A. Kuhn, Herabkunft des Feuers and des Göttertranks, p. 81 seqq. (2nd ed. p. 73 seqq.); Weber, Ind. Streifen I, p. 16 seqq.; K. F. Geldner, in Pischel and Geldner's Vedische Studien I, p. 244 seqq.; cf. H. Oldenberg, Religion des Veda, p. 213.

 'Thrice a day shalt thou embrace [^egg_229] me; but do not lie with me against my will [^egg_230], and let me not see thee naked, for such is the way to behave to us women.'

[^egg_229]: 69:1 Vaitasena daṇḍena hatād,--vaitaso daṇḍaḥ puṁvyañjanasya nāma; uktaṁ hi Yāskena, śepo vaitasa iti puṁsprajananasyeti (Nir. III, 22), Sāy.

2. She then dwelt with him a long time, and was even with child of him, so long did she dwell with him. Then the Gandharvas [^egg_231] said to one another, 'For a long time, indeed, has this Urvaśī dwelt among men: devise ye some means how she may come back to us.' Now, a ewe with two lambs was tied to her couch: the Gandharvas then carried off one of the lambs.

[^egg_231]: 69:3 The Gandharvas are the natural companions and mates of the Apsaras, or nymphs.

4. He then thought within himself, 'How can that be (a place) without a hero and without a man where I am?' And naked, as he was, he sprang

up after them: too long he deemed it that he should put on his garment. Then the Gandharvas produced a flash of lightning, and she beheld him naked even as by daylight. Then, indeed, she vanished: 'Here I am back,' he said, and lo! she had vanished [^egg_233]. Wailing with sorrow he wandered all over Kurukshetra. Now there is a lotus-lake there, called Anyataḥplakshā: He walked along its bank; and there nymphs were swimming about in the shape of swans [^egg_234].

[^egg_233]: 70:1 Cf. C. Gaedicke, Der Accusativ im Veda (1880), p. 211. Previous translators had assigned the words 'punar emi' (I come back) to Urvaśī; and in view of the corresponding passage in paragraph 13, the new interpretation is just a little doubtful.

[^egg_234]: 70:2 The text has 'āti,' some kind of water-bird--jalacarapakshiviśeshaḥ, Sāy.--(probably Gr. νῆσσα; Lat. anas, anat-is; Anglo-S. æned, Germ. Ente).

[^egg_235]: 70:3 That is, they became visible, or rather recognisable to him by showing themselves in their real forms,--pakshirūpaṁ vihāya svakīyena rūpeṇa prādur babhūvuḥ, Sāy.--In Kālidāsa's plays, both Urvaśī and Śakuntalā become invisible by means of a magic veil (tiraskariṇī, 'making invisible') with which has been compared the magic veil by which the swan-maidens change their form.

He then said sorrowing (X, 95, 14), 'Then will thy friend [^egg_237] rush away [^egg_238] this day never to come back, to go to the farthest distance: then will he lie in Nirr̥ti's [^egg_239] lap, or the fierce wolves will devour him; Thy friend will either hang himself, or start forth; or the wolves, or dogs, will devour him!' this is what he meant to say.

[^egg_237]: 71:1 This is a doubtful rendering (Max Müller; Gespiele, A. Weber) of 'sudeva,'--Göttergenoss (the companion of the gods), Kuhn; 'dem die Götter einst hold waren' (he who was formerly favoured by the gods), Grassmann; Sudeva, Ludwig.

[^egg_238]: 71:2 Or, will fall down (Max Müller, Weber); sich in’s Verderben stürzen (will rush to his destruction), Kuhn;--forteilen (hasten away), Grassmann; verloren gehen (get lost), Ludwig; sich in den Abgrund stürzen, Geldner;--'mahāprasthānaṁ kuryāt' (he will set out on the great journey, i.e. die), Sāyaṇa. The Brāhmaṇa seems to propose two different renderings,--to throw oneself down (hang oneself), or, to start forth.

Then her heart took pity on him [^egg_244].

[^egg_241]: 72:1 The words 'rātrīḥ śaradaś catasraḥ' may also be taken in the sense of 'four nights of the autumn' (Max Müller, A. Kuhn). It needs hardly to be remarked that 'nights' means days and nights, and 'autumns' years.--Sāyaṇa takes the passage in the sense of 'four delightful (rātrīḥ ramayitrīḥ) autumns or years.'

[^egg_242]: 72:2 Literally, I walk (or go on, keep) being satisfied therewith. Prof. Geldner, however, takes it in an ironical sense, 'das Bischen liegt mir jetzt noch schwer im Magen' ('even now I have quite enough of that little').

[^egg_243]: 72:3 That is, the theologians of the R̥g-veda. As Prof. Weber points out, the hymn referred to, in the received version, consists not of fifteen but of eighteen verses, three of which would therefore seem to be of later origin (though they might, of course, belong to a different recension from that referred to by the Brāhmaṇa).
