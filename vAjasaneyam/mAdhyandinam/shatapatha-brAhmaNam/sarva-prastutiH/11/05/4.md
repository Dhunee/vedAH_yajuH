1. He says, 'I have come for Brahmacarya [^egg_284]:' he thereby reports himself to the Brahman. He says, 'Let me be a Brahmacārin (student):' he thereby makes himself over to the Brahman. He (the teacher) then says, 'What (ka) is thy name?'--now Ka is Prajāpati: he thus initiates him after making him one belonging to Prajāpati.

[^egg_284]: 86:2 That is, for religious (theological) studentship: 'I have come to be a student.'--Sāyaṇa takes the aorist 'āgām' in an optative sense 'may I enter (or obtain),'--brahmacāriṇo bhāvo brahmacaryaṁ tad āgāṁ prāpnuyām.

'Thou art a Brahmacārin,' he says, and thus commits him to the Brahman;--'sip water!'--water, doubtless, means ambrosia: 'sip ambrosia' is thus what he tells him;--'do thy work!'--work, doubtless, means vigour: 'exert vigour' is thus what he tells him;--'put on fuel!'--'enkindle thy mind with fire, with holy lustre!' is what he thereby tells him;--'do not sleep [^egg_286]!'--'do not die' is what he thereby says to him;--'sip water!'--water means ambrosia: 'sip ambrosia' is what he thus tells him.
