1. Now Uddālaka Āruṇi [^egg_190] was driving about [^egg_191], as a chosen (offering-priest), amongst the people of

[^egg_191]: 50:4 Prof. Geldner takes 'dhāvayāṁ cakāra in a causal sense , 'er verursachte einen Anflauf' (he caused people to crowd together, or to come to him in crowds). Sāyaṇa, however, takes it in the same sense as we have. done,--ārtvijyāya vr̥taḥ sann udagdeśān jagāma. The Gopatha-Br., further on, has the remark 'sa vai gotamasya putra ūrdhvaṁ vr̥todhāvīt' (!).

the northern country. By him a gold coin was offered; for in the time of our forefathers a prize used to be offered by chosen (priests) when driving about, for the sake of calling out the timid [^egg_192] to a disputation. Fear then seized the Brāhmaṇas of the northern people:--

[^egg_192]: 51:1 It is by no means certain whether the interpretation of the paragraph as here adapted is the right one. Prof. Geldner takes it thus,--'He (Udd.) had taken a gold piece with him; for in times of old the chosen (priests) who caused a crowd to gather round them, used to take a single gold piece with them with a view to their proposing a riddle (or problem) whenever they were afraid.' The Gopatha-Br. has a different reading, which is likewise far from clear:--tasya ha nishka upāhito babhūva, upavādād bibhyato yo ma brāhmaṇonūcāna upavadishyati tasmā etam pradāsyāmīti;--by him a gold coin was offered (? by him a gold plate had been put on, i.e. was worn round the neck) being afraid of obloquy (?): 'I shall give this to any learned Brahman who will speak up against me,' thus (he thought).
