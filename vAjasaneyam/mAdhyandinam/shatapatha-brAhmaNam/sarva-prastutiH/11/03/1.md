1. Verily, the Agnihotrī cow is the speech of the Agnihotra, and her calf is its mind. Now these two, mind and speech, whilst being one and the same, are, as it were, distinct from each other: therefore they tie up the calf and its mother with one and the same rope; and the fire [^egg_177], indeed, is faith, and the ghee truth.

[^egg_177]: 46:1 That is, according to Sāyaṇa, the fire, or heat, produced by the rope. Instead of 'teja eva śraddhā,' one would rather expect 'śraddhaiva tejaḥ.'

5. Concerning this point there are also these

verses:--'Knowing what [^egg_178], does the offerer of the Agnihotra stay away from his house? how is his wisdom (manifested) [^egg_179]? how is he kept up by his fires [^egg_180]?'--whereby he means to say, 'How, then, is there no staying away from home on his part [^egg_181]?'

[^egg_178]: 47:1 That is, according to Sāyaṇa,--What form of Agnihotra does he recognise, when he goes to stay abroad?

[^egg_179]: 47:2 That is,--How does he show his knowledge of the sacred obligation that one ought to perform the Agnihotra regularly twice a day for life?

[^egg_180]: 47:3 That is to say, How is the continuity in the constant attendance to his sacred fires kept up by him?

[^egg_181]: 47:4 Literally, 'How is non-staying abroad (brought about)?' that is to say,--How, though having to stay abroad, does he ensure the spiritual benefits of remaining at home? or, as Sāyaṇa puts it, How is the fault of staying abroad, avoided?--asya pravasato yajamānasya anapaproshitam pravāsadoshābhāvaḥ.

6. 'He who is the swiftest in the worlds [^egg_182], that wise one is found staying abroad: thus (is manifested) his wisdom, thus he is kept up by his fires;'--he thereby means the mind: it is owing to his mind that there is no staying away from home on his part.

[^egg_182]: 47:5 Or, among (or in) beings. Sāyaṇa supplies 'yajamānaḥ' to 'yo javishṭḥaḥ.'
