1. Verily, in the beginning this (universe) was water, nothing but a sea of water. The waters desired, 'How can we be reproduced?' They toiled and performed fervid devotions [^egg_100], when they were becoming heated, a golden egg was produced. The year, indeed, was not then in existence: this golden egg floated about for as long as the space of a year.

[^egg_100]: 12:1 Or, they toiled and became heated (with fervid devotion). For this cosmological legend, see J. Muir, Original Sanskrit Texts, iv, p. 24.

2. In a year's time a man, this Prajāpati, was produced therefrom; and hence a woman, a cow, or a mare brings forth within the space of a year; for Prajāpati was born in a year. He broke open this golden egg. There was then, indeed, no resting-place: only this golden egg, bearing him, floated about for as long as the space of a year.

24. They then beheld the northern quarter, and made it the waters. 'Let us improve it from here!' they said, and made it (to represent) the law, for the waters are the law: hence whenever the waters come (down) to this (terrestrial) world everything here comes to be in accordance with the law; but whenever there is drought, then the stronger seizes upon the weaker, for the waters are the law.

30. The Svishṭakr̥t is the same as this downward breathing; and because he offers that (oblation), as it were, apart from the other oblations [^egg_110], therefore all the breathings recoil from that breathing; and because for the Svishṭakr̥t he cuts portions from all the sacrificial dishes, therefore everything that enters these (channels of the other) breathings meets in (the channel of) that breathing.

[^egg_110]: 19:1 See I, 7, 3, 21, where I would now translate, He offers apart (sideways), as it were, from the other oblations,--the oblation to Agni Svishṭakr̥t being poured out on the north side of the fire, so as not to come in contact with the chief oblations and the butter-portions.

31. The three after-offerings are the three male organs [^egg_111]; and that which is the chief after-offering is, as it were, the chief organ. 'He should offer it without drawing breath [^egg_112],' they say, 'for thus it becomes unfailing for him.'

[^egg_111]: 19:2 That is, including the testicles.

[^egg_112]: 19:3 Or, rather,--at the third after-offering (viz. that to Agni Svishṭakr̥t),--the Hotr̥ should (according to some authorities) pronounce the offering-formula, which is considerably longer than those of the two other offerings, without making a pause; whilst others allow him to pause once.

The invitatory and offering-formulas are (in) measured metre, whence the bones of a fat and a lean person are alike: but inasmuch as he takes now more, now less, offering-material, therefore the flesh of a fat person is fat, and the flesh of a lean person is lean.
