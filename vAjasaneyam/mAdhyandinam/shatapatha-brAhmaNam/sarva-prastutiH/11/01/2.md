1. Now when they spread (and perform) the sacrifice, they kill it; and when they press out king Soma, they kill him; and when they 'quiet' and cut up the victim, they kill it,--it is by means of the mortar and pestle, and by the two mill-stones that they kill the Haviryajña (grain-offering).

2. And having killed the sacrifice, he pours it, as seed, into the fire as its womb, for, indeed, the fire is the womb of the sacrifice, from out of it it is produced: let him therefore perform those ten oblations [^egg_75] for which the Vashaṭ is uttered.

[^egg_75]: 3:1 These ten oblations of the New and Full-moon sacrifice (as the model for Haviryajñas generally), as enumerated by Sāyaṇa, are (a) at full moon--five fore-offerings, two butter-portions, two cake-offerings to Agni, and Agni-Soma, and a low-voiced offering to Agni-Soma, (b) at new moon--five fore-offerings, two butter-portions, a cake to Agni, a low-voiced offering to Vishṇu, and an offering of (sweet and sour) milk, or Sānnāyya, to Indra.

3. And, indeed, this sacrifice is the blowing (wind): he blows here, as it were, as a single one, but when he has entered into man, he is divided into ten parts;--with the vital airs thus distributed, it (the sacrifice) is born from out of its womb, the fire: this is that Virāj of ten syllables, this is that perfection, the sacrifice.

[^egg_76]: 3:2 Viz. inasmuch as, according to Sāyaṇa, at the Full-moon sacrifice the offering to Agni-Soma only takes place in the case of one who is a Soma-offerer. I find, however, no authority for this.

9. That (sacrifice) which is defective in two (oblations) [^egg_82] is indeed defective, it is not a sacrifice; and that which is excessive in respect of five (oblations) is indeed excessive, it is not a sacrifice: this is that perfection as regards the ten, the twenty, thus up to a thousand [^egg_83].

[^egg_82]: 4:3 That is, if it includes only eight oblations, see paragraph 4.

[^egg_83]: 4:4 That is, counting every ten (oblations) one Virāj, or metrical pāda of ten syllables.

13. He who, knowing this, offers (the Full and New-moon sacrifice) for thirty years, becomes one of the race-runners, whence one ought to offer sacrifice for not less than thirty years. But if he be a performer of the Dākshāyaṇa sacrifice [^egg_85], he need only offer for fifteen years, for therein that perfection is brought about, since he performs (every month) two Full-moon and two New-moon offerings, and thus that perfection is indeed brought about therein.
