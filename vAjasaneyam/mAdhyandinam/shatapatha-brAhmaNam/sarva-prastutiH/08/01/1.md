1. He lays down the Prāṇabhr̥taḥ (breath-holders) [^egg_34]: now, the Prāṇabhr̥taḥ being--the vital

[^egg_34]: 1:1 The construction of the first of the five layers of the altar which, as far as the special bricks are concerned, is now nearing its completion, may be briefly recapitulated here. The altar (agni) is constructed in the form of a bird, the body (ātman) of which consists of a square, usually measuring four man's lengths, or forty feet (Indian=c. 30 ft. Engl.) on each side. The ground of the 'body' having been ploughed, watered, and sown with seeds of all kinds of herbs, a square mound, the so-called uttaravedi, measuring a yuga (yoke= 7 ft. Ind.) on each side, is thrown up in the middle of the 'body,' and the whole of the latter then made level with it. In the centre of the 'body' thus raised, where the two 'spines'--connecting the middle of each of the four sides of the square with that of the, opposite side--meet, the priest puts down a lotus-leaf, and thereon the gold plate (a symbol of the sun) which the Sacrificer wore round his neck during the time of initiation. On this plate he then lays a small gold figure of a man (representing Agni-Prajāpati, as well as the Sacrificer himself), so as to lie on his back with the head towards the east; and beside him he places two offering-spoons, one on each side, filled with ghee and sour curds  respectively. Upon the man he then places a brick with naturally-formed holes in it (or a porous stone), a so-called Svayam-ātr̥ṇṇā (self-perforated one), of which there are three in the altar, viz. in the centre of the first, third, and fifth layers, supposed to represent the earth, air, and sky respectively, and by their holes to allow the Sacrificer (in effigy) to breathe, and ultimately to pass through on his way to the eternal abodes. On this stone he lays down a plant of dūrvā grass--with the root lying on the brick, and the twigs hanging down--meant to represent vegetation on earth, and food for the Sacrificer. Thereupon he puts down in front (east) of the central stone, on the 'spine,' a Dviyajus brick; in front of that, on both sides of the spine, two Retaḥsic; then in front of them, one Viśvajyotis; then again two R̥tavyāḥ; and finally the Ashāḍḥā, representing the Sacrificer's consecrated consort. These bricks, each of which is a pada (foot, Ind.) square, occupy nearly one-third of the line from the centre to the middle of the front side of the 'body' of the altar. South and north of the Ashāḍḥā, leaving the space of two bricks, he places a live tortoise, facing the gold man, and a wooden mortar and pestle respectively. On the mortar he places the ukhā, or fire-pan, filled with sand and milk; and thereon the heads of the five victims, after chips of gold have been thrust into their mouths, nostrils, eyes, and ears. At each of the four ends of the two spines' he then puts down five Apasyāḥ bricks, the middle one lying on the spine itself, with two on each side of it. The last set of five bricks, those hid down at the north (or left) end of the 'cross-spine,' are also called Cḥandasyāḥ by the Brāhmaṇa. He now proceeds to lay down the Prāṇabhr̥taḥ, meant to represent the orifices of the vital airs, in five sets of ten bricks each. The first four sets are placed on the four diagonals connecting the centre with the four corners of the body of the altar, beginning from the corner (? or, according to some, optionally from the centre), in the order S.E., N.W., S.W., N.E.; the fifth set being then laid down round the central stone at the distance (or, on the range) of the retaḥsic bricks. See the diagram at p. 17.

airs, it is the vital airs he thereby bestows upon (Agni). He lays them down in the first layer;--that which is the first layer is the forepart (ground-part) of Agni: it is thus in front that he puts (into Agni) the vital airs, whence there are (in creatures) these (orifices of the) vital airs in front.

2. He lays them down by ten and ten, for there are ten vital airs; and even though 'ten-ten' may mean many, times, here they mean only ten. Five times he puts on ten (bricks) each time; for it is those five (kinds of sacrificial) animals he bestows, and there are ten vital airs in each .animal: upon all of them he thus bestows the vital airs. He lays down (the bricks) so as not to be separated from the animals: he thus bestows vital airs not separated from the animals. He lays them down on every side: on every side he thus bestows on them (orifices of) the vital airs.

3. And again why he lays down the Prāṇabhr̥taḥ. From Prajāpati, when relaxed (by producing creatures), the vital airs departed. To them, having become deities, he spake, 'Come ye to me, return ye unto me that wherewith ye have gone out of me!'--'Well then, create thou that food which we will await here looking on!'--'Well then, let us both create!'--'So be it!'--So both the final airs and Prajāpati created that food, these Prāṇabhr̥t (bricks).

XIII, 54), 'This one in front, the Existent,'--in front, doubtless, is Agni; and as to why he speaks of him (as being) 'in front,' it is because they take out the fire (from the Gārhapatya) towards the front, and attend on Agni towards the front [^egg_36].

existent (bhuva),' Agni is indeed the existent, for it is through Agni that everything exists (bhū) here. Agni, indeed, having become the breath, remained in front [^egg_37]: it is that very form [^egg_38] he now bestows (on Agni).

[^egg_37]: 4:1 See VII, 5, 1, 7, 'The breath is taken in from the front backwards.'--In the text 'prāṇo hāgnir bhūtvā purastāt tasthau,' I take 'prāṇaḥ' to be the predicate.

[^egg_38]: 4:2 At VII, 4, 1, 16, the vital air is called Prajāpati's (Agni's) pleasing form (or part).

[^egg_40]: 4:4 The Gāyatra-sāman is the simplest, and by far the most common of all hymn-tunes. It is especially used in connection with the trivr̥t-stoma, or nine-versed hymn, and is invariably employed for the Bahishpavamāna-stotra. It is also the tune of the first triplet both of the Mādhyandina and Ārbhava-pavamāna; as well as for all the four Ājya-stotras.

Though its pressing is performed by three turns of eight, eleven, and twelve beatings respectively, representing the three chief metres, it is expressly stated (IV, 1, 1, 14)  that he who is desirous of obtaining holiness, should press eight times at each turn.

[^egg_48]: 6:3 Svāra-sāman is called a chanted verse which has no special concluding nidhana, or finale, but in which the svarita (circumflex), or first rising then falling pitch (ej., f-g-f) of the final vowel, takes the place of the finale; whence 'svāra' is often explained by 'svaranidhana,' i.e. having the svara (svarita) for its nidhana. See  Pañc. Br. IX, 3, 11, where a svāra-sāman is prescribed in case the Udgātr̥s have previously committed an excess in their chanting. The last tristich of the Mādhyandina-pavamānastotra of the Agnishṭoma, the Auśana-sāman (to Sāma-v., vol. ii, pp. 27-29), is chanted in this way, probably in order to make good the excess committed in the preceding triplet, the Yaudhājaya (ii, pp. 25, 26), in which each verse is chanted with three nidhanas, one at the end, and two inserted inside the sāman. Lāṭy. Śrautas. VI, 9, 6, the svāra-sāmans thus treated are called 'padānusvārāṇi;' whilst those with which the musical syllables 'hā-i' are used with a similar effect, are called 'hāikārasvārāṇi.' As an instance of the former, the Auśana (Sāma-v., vol. iii, p. 8r) is adduced, and of the latter the Vāmadevya (iii, p. 89). It is not only the final syllable of a sāman, however, that may be modulated in this way, but also that of a musical section of the sāman; cf. Pañc. Br. X, 12, 2, where the Udgītha is to be so treated to make up for the preceding Prastāva, chanted without a Stobha. Sacrificial calls such as the 'Svāhā' and 'Vashaṭ' are also modulated in this way,' ib. VII, 3, 26; XI, 5, 26.
