Each of the four sides of the retaḥsic rim contains a complete set of four bricks; but as there are five bricks on each side, the one in the left-hand corner (looking at them from the centre of the square) is counted along with the adjoining set. Each set, proceeding from left to right (that is, in sunwise fashion), consists of the following bricks,--āśvinī, vaiśvadevī, prāṇabhr̥t, and apasyā, the last of these occupying the corner spaces. The southern bricks consist, however, of two sets of half-bricks (running with their long sides from west to east), counted as the second and fifth set respectively. The eastern and western bricks are laid down so that their line-marks (which, in the case of the bricks of the second and fourth layers, are of an indefinite number) run from west to east; whilst those of the southern  and northern ones run from south to north. All the five bricks of each class, beginning with the āśvinīs, are laid down at the same time, proceeding again in sunwise fashion (east, south, &c.); the

In the first layer there was, no doubt, a similar enclosure of bricks as the retaḥsic range, but the central space was not left quite empty. In the end, however, the empty spaces are in both cases filled up by 'space-fillers.'

[^egg_81]: 26:3 'Samyañc' may either mean 'tending to one and the same point,' or 'running in the same direction, parallel to each other.' It is probably in the former sense that we have to take it here, though not quite literally, but in so far as the line-marks of these  bricks, if continued towards the centre of the altar, intersect one another. As applied to the quarters this meaning would then modify itself to that of 'facing each other.' On the other hand, it is quite possible that the meaning of 'tending in the same direction' is the one intended; and it would in that case probably apply to the fact that the sets opposite to each other have their line-marks running in the same direction, or are parallel to each other; and this meaning would seem to be implied to the quarters where the author supports his argument by the fact that the wind blows, and the rain falls, in the same direction in all the four quarters (VIII, 2, 3, 2; 5). It is curious that the expression is used by the author in connection with the āśvinī, prāṇabhr̥t, and apasyā, but not with the vaiśvadevī, the line-marks of which all meet in one central point, which is not the case with the others. At VIII, 3, 1, 11, on the other hand, it is used again in connection with the Diśyā bricks, which, in the third layer, occupy exactly the same spaces as the Vaiśvadevīs do here.
