1. And when the Hotr̥ recites this (verse), 'Let Brahmaṇaspati go forward, let the goddess Sūnr̥tā go forward,'--the Adhvaryu, stepping forward, makes offering (by muttering) the wind-names. For at this time the gods were afraid lest the Rakshas, the fiends, might injure that (Pravargya) of theirs in the middle (of the sacrifice): they offered it with the Svāhā-call before (its being taken to) the Āhavanīya, being thus offered they offered it (again) in the fire; and in like manner does this one now offer it with the Svāhā-call before

 (its being taken to) the Āhavanīya, and being thus offered he offers it (again) in the fire.

[^egg_1269]: 483:1 The exact meaning of 'hārdvānam' is doubtful. Mahīdhara analyses it by 'hārd' = 'hr̥d', + 'vāna,' blowing, going, hence 'heart-wafting, going to the heart = dear to the heart.' The St. Petersb. Dict. takes the word to be 'hārd-van,' in the sense of 'herzstärkend' (heart-sustaining, invigorating--? literally, 'possessed of heartiness'). The Taitt. Ār. has 'hārdivānam' instead. The author of the Brāhmaṇa apparently considers the term as obscure, and uses this circumstance for his own symbolic purposes.

[^egg_1270]: 483:2 Perhaps the author means to characterise also the epithet  'ahar-diva' (lit. 'day-daily,' cf. Germ. tagtäglich; Aberdonian 'daily-day') as obscure. Mahīdhara takes it to mean 'relating to morning and evening,' as applying to the two performances of the Pravargya,

[^egg_1272]: 484:2 That is, as would seem, he speaks the anumantraṇa in order to consecrate whatever milk might have been spilled in bubbling over. Possibly, however, he is to do so at the time when the pot bubbles over (though the 'atha' would rather be out of place in that case). The Taittirīyas differ somewhat on this point of the performance.  After the Gharma-milk has been offered, the Pratiprasthātr̥ fills the Mahāvīra pot, whilst it is held over the fire, with boiled sour curds and whey (dadhi), whilst muttering the text, 'The Aśvins drank the Gharma . . .,' and with the texts; 'For freshness swell thou,' &c.

 --whereby he means to say, 'For rain . . .;'--'for vigour swell thou!'--he thereby means the vigour, the life-sap, which results from the rain;--'for the Brahman swell thou!'---he thereby means the priesthood;--'for the Kshatra swell thou!'--he thereby means the nobility;--'for Heaven and Earth swell thou!'--he thereby means these two, the heaven and the earth, within which everything here is contained.

[^egg_1277]: 487:1 If this rendering (St. Petersb. Dict.) of ūrdhvabarhis' is correct--the term being apparently based on the Fathers’ epithet 'barhishadaḥ,' 'seated on the barhis' (sacrificial grass-covering of the altar-ground)--the force of 'ūrdhva' in the compound is very peculiar. Mahīdhara takes it in the sense of 'having their barhis pointed upwards,' i.e. towards the east (!), the peculiar feature of the barhis in the present case--as far as the participation of the Fathers in the drinking of the Gharma is concerned--being its having the tops of the grass-stalks turned to the east instead of to the south, as is the case in all ceremonies relating to the Fathers. The term 'ūrdhvabarhis' might possibly mean 'having their (special) barhis above,' i.e. in the world of the Fathers, where they would be supposed to partake of the libations of hot milk; whilst yet another (suggested by the next paragraph) would be that of 'having the barhis above them;' which would, however, be more appropriate if the secreting of the stick under the barhis applied to the present, instead of the next one.
