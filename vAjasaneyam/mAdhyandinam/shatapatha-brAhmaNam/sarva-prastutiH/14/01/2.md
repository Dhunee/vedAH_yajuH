1. He equips (the Mahāvīra) with its equipments;--inasmuch as he equips it therewith from this and that quarter, that is the equipping nature of the equipments [^egg_1179] (sambhāra): wheresoever anything of the sacrifice is inherent, therewith he equips it [^egg_1180].

[^egg_1179]: 447:1 See part i, p. 276, note 1. Here, as formerly, it has not been thought desirable to adhere throughout to the technical rendering of 'sam-bhr̥'

[^egg_1180]: 447:2 Pravargya being masculine, the original would, of course, have 'him' here and throughout, the ceremony (just like the sacrifice in general) being indeed looked upon as a person.

In making the Gharma, or Mahāvīra,  pot, on the present occasion, the order of proceeding is to a considerable extent the same as that followed at the Agnicayana, in providing the materials for, and making, the fire-pan, for which, see VI, 3, 3, 1 seqq. Cf. also the Āpastamba Śrautas. XV, with Garbe's Translation and Notes, Journal of Germ. Or. Soc., vol. xxxiv.

sacrifice he thus prepares (the pot);--with its hairy side (upwards),--for the hairs are the metres: on the metres he thus prepares it;--(spread out) on the left (north) side [^egg_1182],--for the north is the quarter of men;--on (the skin) with its neck-part to the east [^egg_1183], for that (tends) towards the gods.

[^egg_1183]: 448:2 The locative, instead of the accusative, is rather strange here. As it stands, the locative is evidently parallel to 'yajñe' and 'chandaḥsu,' and one has therefore to supply--he collects (prepares) the Pravargya, viz. by putting the lump of clay and the other objects thereon.

[^egg_1188]: 450:1 The pronouns in this and the subsequent corresponding formulas (vāṁ, vaḥ, te) are taken by Mahīdhara as accusatives ('te' according to him standing for 'tvām') to which he supplies 'ādāya'--'having taken you, may I this day compass Makha's head.' The pronouns are certainly somewhat awkward, as they can scarcely be taken as genitives of material--of you, of thee.

Mahīdhara also, apparently influenced by the Brāhmaṇa, explains, 'the earth is the firstborn of creatures, and, from their connection with it, ants also are called firstborn.'

At the top he then draws it out (so as to form) a spout [^egg_1200] of three thumbs’ breadths (high): he thereby makes a nose to this (Mahāvīra, or Pravargya). When it is complete, he touches it with (Vāj. S. XXXVII, 8), 'Makha's head thou art,'--for it indeed is the head of Makha Saumya (the Soma-sacrifice). In the same way (he makes) the other two (Mahāvīra pots [^egg_1201]); silently two milking-bowls (pinvana [^egg_1202]), and silently two Rauhiṇa-plates [^egg_1203].

[^egg_1198]: 454:1 That is, from bottom to top, a belt (mekhalā) running round it at the distance of three thumbs' breadths from the top (Mahīdhara, and comm. on Katy.). This top part above the belt--here simply called 'mouth,' whilst in the Āpast. Śr. XV, 2, 14 it is called 'back' (sānu)--ends in a hole for pouring the liquid in and out.

[^egg_1199]: 454:2 That is, for taking hold of it (mushṭigrahaṇayogyam, comm. on Katy.).

[^egg_1200]: 454:3 'Mukha,' for which Katy. XXVI, 1, 16 has 'āsecana' explained by the commentator as a hole (garta; comm. on Āśv. Gr̥hyas. IV, 3 bila), apparently serving as the mouth, or open part of the vessel which seems to be otherwise closed. The edge of the hole would seem to protract sufficiently from the surface to suggest a similarity to the nose. In making the vessel, it seems first to be left solid, the open part which is to hold the milk being then hollowed out by means of a reed from the top hole to the depth of less than the upper half, the remainder remaining solid. Cf. Āśv. Śr. XV, 3, 4.

[^egg_1201]: 454:4 Only the first of the three pots is, however, actually used; unless it gets broken by accident.

[^egg_1202]: 454:5 According to the comm. on Katy. Sr., these vessels are of the form of the (hand-shaped) bowl of an offering-ladle (sruc, cf. part i, p. 67, note 2).

[^egg_1203]: 454:6 The Rauhiṇa-kapālas are two round, flat dishes for baking the Rauhiṇa cakes on.

18. Verily this sacrifice is Prajāpati, and Prajāpati

is both of this, defined and undefined, limited and unlimited [^egg_1204]. Whatever one does with a Yajus formula, by that one makes up that form of him (Prajāpati) which is defined and limited; and whatever one does silently, by that one makes up that form of him which is undefined and unlimited: verily, then, whosoever, knowing this, does it on this wise, makes up that whole and complete Prajāpati. But he also leaves over a lump of spare (clay) for expiations.

Texts, vol. v, p. 393, where a passage is quoted from Prof. Cowell's translation of the Maitri-Upanishad (VI, 3), 'There are two forms of Brahma, the embodied (mūrta) and the unembodied (amūrta): the former is unreal (asatya), the latter real (satya).'--Cf.

He then smooths [^egg_1205] it by means of Gavedhukā grass (Coix barbata),--for when the sacrifice had its head cut off, its vital sap flowed away, and therefrom those plants grew up: with that vital sap he thus supplies and completes it;--with, 'For Makha thee! for Makha's head thee!' the import of this is the same as before, In the same way the other two (Mahāvīra pots); silently the two milking-bowls, silently the two Rauhiṇa-plates.

[^egg_1205]: 455:2 The Sūtras use the verbs 'ślakshṇayati, ślakshṇīkurvanti' (to make smooth, or soft), and this, I think, must indeed be the meaning of 'hinv.' It would also suit very well the passage III, 5, 1, 35, where it is said that the Vedi is a woman, and that, by sprinkling the former with water, one 'makes her smooth' for the gods. The polishing of the vessels is done by rubbing them with Gavedhukā grass, whether with the spike, stem, or leaves is not specified.

He bakes them by means of bricks, for they it was that did so on that occasion [^egg_1206]: just in accordance with the way in which the head of the sacrifice was there cut off, he now supplies and completes it with those (bricks), But, indeed, let him bake them with anything [^egg_1207] whereby they may become properly baked.
