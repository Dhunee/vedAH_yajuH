3. He (the Āgnīdhra) then hands the sacrificial grass [^egg_245] to him (the Adhvaryu). The latter puts it down (on the altar) with the knot turned to the east, and sprinkles it, with the text (Vāj. S. II, I), 'Barhis art thou! I sprinkle thee, agreeable to the spoons!' He thereby makes it sacrificially pure for the spoons.

[^egg_245]: 84:2 'At the beginning of the sacrifice the Adhvaryu makes of the load of Darbha or sacred grass, which has been brought to the sacrificial compound, seven mushṭis or bunches, each of which is tied together with a stalk of grass, just as the Baresma (Barsom) of the Parsis. The several names of these seven bunches are, 1. Vajamānamushṭi, the bunch kept by the sacrificer himself in his hand as long as the sacrifice lasts. 2. Three bunches from the Barhis, or the covering of the Vedi on which the sacrificial vessels are put. These are unloosened and spread all over the Vedi. 3. Prastara. This bunch, which must remain tied, is put over the Darbha of the Vedi. 4. Paribhojanī. From this bunch the Adhvaryu takes a handful out for each priest, and the sacrificer and his wife, which they then use for their seat. 5. The Veda. This bunch is made double in its first part; the latter part is cut off and has to remain on the Vedi; it is called parivāsana. The Veda itself is always wandering from one priest to the other, and is given to the sacrificer and his wife. It is handed over to the latter only when one of the priests makes her recite a mantra.' Haug's translation of the Ait. Br. p. 79.

Aditi, indeed, is this earth; hence it is for the latter that he thus moistens the roots of the plants: thereby these plants become root-moistened; and even if their tops are dry, their roots at least remain moist.

5. Having thereupon untied the knot, he takes the prastara bunch from the front (of the barhis), with the text (Vāj. S. II, 2), 'Vishṇu's crest art thou!' Vishṇu, namely, is the sacrifice, and this (the prastara) is his top-knot or crest: this he thereby makes it at this sacrifice [^egg_246]. From the front he takes it, because this top-knot also is (worn) on the front (of the head): for this reason he takes it from the front.

[^egg_246]: 85:1 Because, according to Sāyaṇa, it lies on the front, or eastern side of the altar, near the Āhavanīya fire, and men also wear their topknot (in the form of a ball or lump) on the fore-part of their head. The prastara he hands to the Brahman-priest. Katy. II, 7, 22.

10. Here now they say, 'Let him strew abundantly; for where the plants are most abundant on her, there the means of subsistence are most amply afforded by her: let him therefore strew abundantly!' It is in favour of him (the sacrificer) who procures (the sacrificial grass), then, (that this is done.) He strews it threefold [^egg_249], for threefold is the sacrifice. Or he may also spread it whilst lifting up (the tops) [^egg_250]; for

He first spreads a layer on the east side from the southern to the northern shoulder of the altar, with the tops of the blades turned towards the east; then a second one west of it, so as to cover the roots of the first with the tops of the second layer; and in the same way a third one on the west side of the altar. If he thinks fit, he may make more than three layers, but their number should be uneven. Kāty. II, 7, 22-26 (schol.).

[^egg_250]: 86:3 That is to say, he is to begin on the west side, and in laying down the successive layers, he is to lift up (with a stick or some  other object) the heads of the preceding layer and push the roots of the succeeding one under them. Ib. 27 (schol.).



it has been said by the seer (Vāj. S. VII, 32), 'They spread the barhis continuously.' He spreads it with the roots below (the tops); for it is with their roots below that those plants are firmly established in this earth: for this reason he spreads it with the roots below.

Already you have chosen three before,

and they have passed away [^egg_253]. Restore them to me: then I shall be equal to this, that I should be your Hotr̥ and that I should carry your oblation!' They said, 'So be it!' and they restored to him those (three former Agnis): they are these enclosing-sticks.

Lest that thunderbolt, the vashaṭ-call, should strike me down, enclose me by those (three Agnis, or paridhis); and thus that thunderbolt, the vashaṭ-call, will not strike me down.' They said, 'So be it!' and they enclosed him with those (three sticks), and that thunderbolt, the vashaṭ call, did not strike him down. When he encloses Agni with those (sticks) he buckles armour on him.

[^egg_254]: 88:2 The call 'vashaṭ' (or vaushaṭ), apparently signifying 'may he (Agni) carry it (the oblation) up!' (from vah, to bear, carry), is pronounced by the Hotr̥ at the end of the yāgyās or offering prayers (see note on I, 5, 1, 16). Professor Weber has somewhere proposed to derive it from vaksh, to grow, increase, hence 'may it prosper, or agree, with you!' Different, but quite fanciful, interpretations of vashaṭ are given Śat. Br. I, 5, 2, 18; Ait. Br. 3, 6. As to the awful solemnity of this formula, and the danger arising from a careless use of it, see Ait. Br. 3, 8, on which Haug remarks, 'Up to the present day the Shrotriyas or sacrificial priests never dare to pronounce this formula save at the time of sacrificing. They say that if they would do so at any other time, they would be cursed by the gods.'
