7. Indra thought with himself, 'They are now excluding me from Soma!' and though uninvited, he consumed what pure (Soma) there was in the tub, even as the stronger (consumes) that of a weaker. That (Soma) however, injured him; it flowed in all directions from (the openings of) his vital airs; from his mouth alone it did not flow, but from all the other (openings of the) vital airs it flowed; hence (was instituted) at that time the ishṭi, called Sautrāmaṇī: on the occasion of that (ceremony) it is explained how the gods healed him [^egg_383].

[^egg_384]: 165:2 According to Taitt. S. II, 4, 12, 1, also the fault committed by Tvashṭr̥ consisted in his faulty accentuation of the compound indraśatru in the formula. What he intended to say was that Agni, on drinking the Soma, should grow strong so as to be 'the foe (slayer) of Indra,' and the compound should therefore have been accented on the second member, viz. indraśátru (the foe of  Indra); but by accenting it on the first member, indraśatru, he made it 'having Indra for his foe (slayer).' According to the version of the Taitt. S., Agni, the fire, on the Soma being poured into it, rose up (spirted) as if to execute Tvashṭr̥'s wish; but immediately relapsed into its former state of inertness on hearing the mis-pronounced word.

27. On this point it has also been remarked: 'Why this sameness (of performance)? By what is introduced between the butter(-offering) to Agni and Soma and the rice-cake to Agni and Soma, a repetition of performance (is committed) [^egg_393].' Sameness (of performance), nevertheless, is avoided in this way: the one (viz. the low-voiced offering) consists of butter, and the other of a rice-cake, hence the one is different from the other. Moreover, after reciting a R̥k-verse as anuvākyā, he pronounces the yājyā with the word 'pleased' (in the case of the butter-portions to Agni and Soma); and after reciting a R̥k-verse as anuvākyā, he pronounces the yājyā in the form of a R̥k-verse (in the case of the low-voiced offering to Agni and Soma), hence the one is (again) different from the other [^egg_394]. Sameness of performance is also avoided in this way: in a low voice (he utters the formulas when) he offers of the butter, and with a loud voice of the cake; and what is (uttered) in a low voice, that is the manner of Prajāpati: hence he recites for that (low-voiced

[^egg_393]: 170:1 See p. 80, note 2. The objection here raised is, that the low-voiced offering, which is intermediate between the two above-mentioned oblations to Agni-Soma, is made to the same two deities.

[^egg_394]: 170:2 When the two butter-portions to Agni and Soma are offered, the Hotr̥ recites the verses Rig-veda VI, 16, 34 (Vāj. S. 33, 9), and Rig-veda, I, 95, 5 (Vāj. S. 19, 42) respectively, as anuvākyās, or invitatory prayers, each of which is followed by the yājyā (offering-formula): 'We who pronounce the offering-prayer to Agni (or Soma respectively),--may Agni (Soma) pleased (jushāṇaḥ) accept of the butter-oblation! Vāushaṭ!' At the low-voiced offering (upāṁśuyāja) to Agni-Soma, on the other hand, he first utters (in a low voice) as anuvākyā the verse Rig-veda I, 93, 2, and thereupon as yājyā Rig-veda I, 93, 6.

By means of that low-voiced offering the gods stealing near slew, with that thunderbolt, the vashaṭ-call, whichever they wished of the Asuras; and so does this one, after stealing near by means of that low-voiced offering, slay with that thunderbolt, the vashaṭ-call, the wicked, spiteful enemy [^egg_395]. This is why he performs the low-voiced offering.

[^egg_395]: 171:1 The two prayers of the low-voiced offering are muttered in a low voice; but the 'Vāushaṭ!' at the end of the offering-prayer (as the 'Om!' at the end of the invitatory prayer) is uttered aloud. Hence the above symbolical explanation.

Now he who (enters on the) fast at the very time (of full moon), gets, as it were, into collision [^egg_397] (with some one); and when two come into collision with one another, it is indeed doubtful which of the two will get the better of the other. He, on the other hand, who prefers to fast on the second day (only), is as one who crushes from behind a retreating (enemy) before he is able to resist the attack: striking in one direction [^egg_398], in fact, is he who thus keeps the fast on the second day only.

[^egg_397]: 172:1 Sam-kramate, literally 'comes together with, meets (somebody).' This symbolical explanation was probably suggested by the circumstance that the full moon marks the junction (sandhi) of the two pakshas or half months; whereas the new moon (amāvāsyā, 'dwelling together') marks the point of least distance between sun and moon.

39. Some people offer Agni's butter-portion in the north-eastern part (of the fire), and Soma's butter-portion in the south-eastern part, thinking, 'Thereby we place the eyes in the front (of the head).' This, however, is rather unintelligible; for the several dishes of sacrificial food (havis) represent the body of the sacrifice; when therefore he offers in front of (or before) the havis, he thereby places the eyes in the front. Let him rather make the offerings (in that part of the fire) where he thinks the fiercest blaze is; for only by being offered in blazing (fire) are oblations successful [^egg_399].

[^egg_399]: 174:1 Katy. III, 3, 20-22 admits either mode of offering the butter-portions. These oblations are effected in the following way:--The Adhvaryu, having called on the Hotr̥ to recite the anuvākyā, takes with the dipping-spoon (sruva) butter from the dhruvā and puts it into the juhū; he then draws some with the sruva from the butter-pot and replenishes the dhruvā with it [according to the Kāṇvas, with the text 'May the dhruvā fatten with the havis-butter, sacrifice after sacrifice, for those who go to the gods,--the udder of Sūryā in the lap of Aditi: may the earth flow abundantly at this sacrifice!']. The same process is then repeated three (additional) times (with a Jamadagni four times): hence the offering is said to consist of four (or five) cuttings. The Hotr̥ then recites the anuvākyā (see note on I, 6, 3, 27), which is followed by the Adhvaryu's call 'om śrāvaya' and the Āgnīdhra's response 'astu śraushaṭ.' Thereupon the Hotr̥, having been called upon by the Adhvaryu to give the offering-prayer to Agni (or Soma), recites the respective yājyā, at the concluding vaushaṭ of which the oblation is poured into the fire, (whilst the sacrificer utters the usual dedicatory formula, 'This for Agni (Soma), not for me!')
