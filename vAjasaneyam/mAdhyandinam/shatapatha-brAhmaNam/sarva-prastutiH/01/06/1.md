1. Now the Seasons were desirous to have a share in the sacrifice among the gods, and said, 'Let us share in the sacrifice! Do not exclude us from the sacrifice! Let us have a share in the sacrifice!'

3. Those (Asuras) then throve in such a manner that they (the gods) heard of it; for even while the foremost (of the Asuras) were still ploughing and sowing, those behind them were already engaged in reaping and threshing: indeed even without tilling the plants ripened forthwith for them.

4. This now caused anxiety to the gods: 'That owing to that (desertion of the Seasons), enemy

 (viz. the Asuras) seeks to injure enemy (viz. us) is of little consequence; but this indeed goes too far: try to find out how henceforth this may be different [^egg_367]!'

[^egg_367]: 156:1 'Kanīya in nv ato dvishan dvishate ’rātīyati kim v etāvanmātram upajānīta yathedam ito ’nyathāsad iti.' The Kāṇva MS. has, 'tad u vai devānām atathāsa kanīya in nu tam dvishan dvishate ’rātīyed atha kiṁ tāvanmātram. Te hocuḥ katham idam ito no ’nyathā syād iti.'

6. Agni then said, 'But whereas hitherto you used to offer prayer to me in the first place, what is now to become of me?' 'We will not remove you from your place!' said they. And since, in inviting the Seasons, they did not remove Agni from his place, for that reason Agni is immutable [^egg_368]; and verily, he who knows that Agni to be immutable, does not move from the place where he bides.

[^egg_368]: 156:2 Acyuta, literally 'not fallen,' hence invariable, indispensable is an epithet frequently applied to Agni's sacrificial cake; cf. I, 4, 2, 16; I, 6, 2, 5.

8. The Seasons said to Agni, 'We will let thee share along with us in the sacrifice who hast obtained for us a share in the sacrifice among the gods!' And because Agni has been allowed a share along with the Seasons (the offering-prayers are): 'The Samidhs, O Agni, (may accept the butter) [^egg_369] . . . !'

[^egg_369]: 156:3 See p. 148, note 2.

 'Tanūnapāt, O Agni . . .!' 'The Iḍs, O Agni . . .!' 'The Barhis, O Agni. . .!' 'Svāhā Agni!' And verily, whosoever knows that Agni is thus allowed to share (in the sacrifice) along with the Seasons, he is allowed to participate in whatever auspicious rite is performed by one who professes to be equal (in that knowledge) to him;--for him, being possessed of Agni, the Seasons, themselves possessed of Agni, ripen the plants and everything here.

9. Now, as to this point, some raise the objection, 'But since they invite the fore-offerings last of all (at the two libations of butter) [^egg_370], why do they offer prayer to them first of all?'--Because they established them last of all in the sacrifice [^egg_371]; and because they said, 'we will offer prayer to you first:' for that reason they invite them last, and offer prayer to them first.

[^egg_370]: 157:1 In the devatānām āvahanam or invitation of the deities, the last formula, addressed to the butter-drinking deities, is supposed to refer to the fore- and after-offerings. Cf. I, 4, 2, 16-17.
