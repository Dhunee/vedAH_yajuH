1. He (the Adhvaryu) drives the calves away (from the cows) with a parṇa branch [^egg_420]. The reason why he drives the calves away with a parṇa branch is this. When the Gāyatrī flew towards Soma (the moon), a footless archer aiming at her while she was carrying him off, severed one of the feathers (parṇa) either of the Gāyatrī or of king Soma [^egg_421]; and on falling down it became a parṇa (palāśa) tree; whence its name parṇa. May that

[^egg_420]: 183:1 Parṇa = palāśa, Butea Frondosa.

[^egg_421]: 183:2 Gāyatryai vā somasya vā='both of G. and of S.,' Sāyaṇa. Apād astā, 'a footless shooter,' is a doubtful reading and perhaps an old corruption; Sāyaṇa reads apādhastā (? adhastāt); cf. Weber, various readings, p. 133. The Kāṇva MS. reads, 'devebhyas tasyā āharantyā avādastābhyāyatya parṇaṁ pracicḥeda.' According to Rig-veda IV, 27, 3, it was the archer Kr̥śānu, who hit the falcon when it was carrying off the Soma from heaven, and brought down one of its feathers. On the whole myth, see A. Kuhn, Herabkunft des Feuers and des Göttertranks, p. 137 seq. Cf. Taitt. S. III, 5, 7, 1; Taitt. Br. I, 1, 3, 10, 'Soma was in the third heaven from here; Gāyatrī fetched him away; one of his feathers was cut off, it became a parṇa (palāśa) tree.' Similarly Taitt. Br. I, 2, 1, 6; see also Śat. Br. I, 8, 2, 10.

which then was of the Soma nature [^egg_422] be here with us now!' so he thinks, and for this reason he drives away the calves with a parṇa branch.

2. That (branch) he cuts off [^egg_423], with the formula (Vāj. S. I, 1 a, b), 'For sap (I cut) thee! for pith thee!'--'for rain thee' he means to say, when he says 'for sap thee;' and when he says 'for pith thee' he means to say 'for that food-essence which springs from the rain.'

[^egg_423]: 184:2 This act as well as that of letting the calves join the cows, of course, precedes the driving away of the calves. These proceedings take place on the day before the new moon, after the agnyanvādhāna. According to Kāty., the sacrificer enters on the vow of abstinence, after the branch has been cut. Previously to these rites, however, the so-called Piṇḍa-pitr̥yajña, or oblation of obsequial piṇḍas (balls, dumplings) to the deceased ancestors, has to be performed; for which see II, 4, 2, 1 seq.

3. They then let the calves join their mothers. He thereupon touches (each) calf (in order to drive it away from the cow), with the formula (Vāj. S. I, 1 c), 'The winds are ye!'--for, indeed, it is this wind that here blows [^egg_424], it is this (wind) that makes swell all the rain that falls here; it is it that makes those (cows) swell; and for this reason he says 'the winds are ye!' Some people add here the formula [^egg_425], 'Going near are ye!' but let him not say this, because thereby another (an enemy) approaches (the sacrificer).

10. That night he performs the Agnihotra with rice-gruel (yavāgū). That milk, namely, (which he milks that night) has already been announced as sacrificial food to a (special) deity; hence, if he were to make the offering with milk, he would offer to one deity that which has been set apart as sacrificial food for another deity: this is the reason why on that night he performs the Agnihotra with rice-gruel. As soon as they have performed the Agnihotra, the pot is made ready. He (the Adhvaryu) thereupon says, 'Announce that she (the cow) has been let loose to (the calf)!'
