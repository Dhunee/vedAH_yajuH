1. Now the one (viz. the Āgnīdhra) puts the potsherds on (the Gārhapatya fire); the other (viz. the Adhvaryu) the two mill-stones (on the black antelope skin): these two acts are done simultaneously. The reason why they are done simultaneously (is this):

2. The head of this sacrifice is (represented by) the rice-cake [^egg_142]: for those potsherds (kapāla), no doubt, are to this (rice-cake) what the skull bones (kapāla) are to the head, and the ground rice is

[^egg_142]: 32:3 This idea was no doubt suggested by the derivation of the word puroḍāś (rice-cake), from puras, 'before, in front, at the head,' and dāś, 'to offer' (see I; 6, 2, 5 ); the double meaning of kapāla (shell or cup and skull) being made use of to complete the simile.

nothing else than the brain. Now this (combination of skull and brain) certainly forms one limb: 'Let us put that (which is) one together! Let us make it one!' thus they think; and therefore the two acts are done simultaneously.

3. He who puts the potsherds on (the fire), takes the shovelling-stick (upavesha), with the text (Vāj. S. I, 17 a): 'Bold (dhr̥shṭi) art thou!' For since with it he, as it were, attacks the fire boldly, therefore it is called dhr̥shṭi [^egg_143]. And since with it he touches (the coals) at the sacrifice, since with it he attends to (upa-vish) this (Gārhapatya fire), therefore it is called upavesha.

[^egg_143]: 33:1 The upavesha, or dhr̥shṭi, is made of fresh varaṇa or palāśa wood, a cubit (aratni) or span (vitasti) long; one of its ends having the shape of a hand (hastākr̥ti), to serve as a coal shovel; cf. Mahīdh. and Schol. on Kāty. I, 3, 36; II, 4, 26. Dhr̥shṭi is apparently derived from the root dhr̥sh, 'to be bold.'

For the raw flesh-eating (fire) is the one with which men cook what they eat; and the corpse-eating one is that on which they burn (the dead) man: these two he thereby expels from it (the Gārhapatya).

6. On it he places the central potsherd [^egg_146]. For

[^egg_146]: 34:1 In Yājñika Deva's commentary on Katy. II, 4, 37, full explanations are given regarding the manner of arranging the potsherds (kapālas) on which the sacrificial cakes are spread, and which vary in number and shape. The Adhvaryu is first to describe a circle, the diameter of which is six aṅgulas (an aṅgula or thumb's breadth=about ¾ inch). This circle he then divides into three parts by drawing across, from west to east, two parallel lines at a distance of two aṅgulas from one another, so as to make the two outer (or southern and northern) segments of equal size. The middle division he then covers with three equal square potsherds (measuring two aṅgulas on each side), by laying down first the central one, then the one behind or west of it, and lastly the front or eastern one. He then lays down another (the fourth) south of the first or central one; after which he divides the still remaining potsherds equally between the southern and the northern segments, or, in case of that number being uneven, assigns the odd potsherd to the southern division. Thus, in the present case, where in the first place a cake on eight potsherds is to be offered to Agni; after laying down the three intermediate ones and the fourth, or central one of the southern division, he divides the remaining four equally between the southern and northern segments, beginning, in laying them down, in the south-east corner, and moving around from right to left, so as to end in the north-east. Similarly in the case of the cake on eleven potsherds for Agnīshomau, after laying down the first four potsherds, he assigns four of the remaining seven to the southern, and three to the northern division. Thus with cakes requiring an uneven number of potsherds, the number of those of the southern division exceeds that of the northern one by two; and in the case of an even number, by one only. This is the rule applying to cakes requiring at least six potsherds. When one potsherd only is required, it is to be of the size of a hand; when two, they are to form a circle divided into two equal parts by a line drawn from south to north; when three, the circle is divided into three sections from south to north; when four or five, it is divided into two halves from west to east; and in the one case three potsherds are placed in the southern and one (of half-moon shape) in the northern half; in the other case three in the northern and two in the southern division. The potsherds,  though mostly irregular in shape, must always exactly fit one another, so as not to leave any space between. This is effected by rubbing the edges. The cake itself is to be of the shape of a tortoise; the convex shield, or carapace, of the latter consisting of plates arranged in a somewhat similar way as the potsherds of most cakes, viz. in a central (dorsal) and two lateral sets.

the gods, when they were performing sacrifice, were in fear of a disturbance from the Asuras and Rakshas. They were afraid lest those evil spirits, the Rakshas, might rise from below them. Now Agni (fire) is the repeller of the Rakshas, and for this reason he thus places (the potsherd) on it. The reason why it is just this (coal) and no other (on which the potsherd is put) is, that this one, having been consecrated by the (above) sacrificial formula, is sacrificially pure: that is why he places the central potsherd on it.

Mr. Ralph Griffith (Translation of the Rámáyan, I, p. 90) has compared this Hindu rite of pradakshiṇa or dakshiṇīkaraṇa with the Gaelic deasil, as described in the following passage of Sir W. Scott's The Two Drovers: "But it is little I would care for the food that nourishes me, or the fire that warms me, or for God's blessed sun itself, if aught but weel should happen to the grandson of my father. So let me walk the deasil round you, that you may go safe out into the far foreign land, and come safe home." Robin Oig stopped, half embarrassed, half laughing, and signing to those near that he only complied with the old woman to soothe her humour. In the meantime she traced around him, with wavering steps, the propitiation, which some have thought has been derived from the Druidical mythology. It consists, as is well known, in the person, who makes the deasil, walking three times round the person who is the object of the ceremony, taking care to move according to the course of the sun.' Cf. note at p. 45. Note also the etymological connection between dakshiṇa and deiseil (Old Ir. dessel, from dess, Gael. deas, south or right side). For the corresponding rite (dextratio) at the Roman marriage ceremonies see Rossbach, Römische Ehe, pp. 315, 316; Weber, Ind. Stud. V, p. 221.

19. He then grinds it, with the text (Vāj. S. I, 20): 'For out-breathing (I grind) thee! for in-breathing thee! for through-breathing (pervading vital air) [^egg_157] thee! May I impart a long duration to the life (of the sacrificer) [^egg_158]!' He pours it (the ground rice on the skin), with the text (ib.): 'May the divine Savitr̥, the golden-handed, receive thee with a flawless hand [^egg_159]!' 'For his (the sacrificer's) eye (I look at) thee [^egg_160]!'

[^egg_157]: 40:1 On the three kinds of breathing, see I, 1, 3, 2-3.

[^egg_158]: 40:2 According to Kātyāyana (II, 5, 7) and Mahīdhara, this last formula ('May I,' &c.) should be joined to the one that follows, and pronounced by the Adhvaryu whilst he pours the ground rice on the skin. Mahīdhara interprets it thus: 'I put thee, (O rice! on the black antelope skin) for (increasing) the life (of the sacrificer) with a view to a long continuance (of the sacrificial work);' or 'I place thee along the long expanse (i.e. the skin) for thy (the rice's) long life!'

[^egg_159]: 40:3 See I, 1, 4, 23.

[^egg_160]: 40:4 Thus, according to Kāty. or Mahīdh., whilst he looks at the ground rice on the skin.

20. The reason why he thus grinds it, is that the sacrificial food of the gods is living, is amr̥ta (ambrosia, or not dead) for the immortals. Now with the mortar and pestle, and with the two millstones they kill this rice-offering (haviryajña).

21. When he now says: 'For out-breathing thee! for in-breathing thee!' he thereby again imparts out-breathing and in-breathing (to it), and by saying 'for through-breathing thee!' he imparts through-breathing (to it). By 'may I impart a long duration to the life!' he bestows life on it. By 'may the divine Savitr̥, the golden-handed, receive thee with a flawless

hand!' he says: 'May they be well received!' By 'for the eye thee!' he bestows eye-sight on it. Now these (attributes) are those of a living being; and thus that sacrificial food for the gods is indeed living, is amr̥ta (ambrosia, or not dead) for the immortals. This is the reason why he thus grinds (the rice). (Whilst) they are grinding the (ground) grains [^egg_161], (and whilst) they are heating the potsherds,--

[^egg_161]: 41:1 Piṁshanti pishṭāni; the grinding of the ground or grinding of flour (pishṭa-peshaṇa) is a common expression in later Sanskrit for doing a useless work ('carrying owls to Athens,' or coals to Newcastle'). In the present passage, however, the phrase has to be understood, according to Sāyaṇa, as meaning 'whilst they (the sacrificer's people) carry on the work of grinding begun by the Adhvaryu.'

22. Some one [^egg_162] pours clarified butter (into the ājyasthālī, or butter-pot). Now whatever oblation, in being taken, is announced to a (particular) deity, that belongs to the respective deity, that he takes with a special prayer; but in taking this oblation, to wit, the butter, he does not announce it to any particular deity, and therefore takes it with an undefined formula, viz. with (Vāj. S. I, 20): 'Juice of the great ones art thou!' For 'the great ones' some (take to be) a name for the cows; and their juice indeed it is: for this reason he says, 'The juice of the great ones art thou!' And thus, moreover, is some of that (butter) taken with a sacrificial formula: and for this reason also he says, 'The juice of the great ones art thou!'

[^egg_162]: 41:2 The Āgnīdhra or somebody else, according to Sāyaṇa; but according to the Schol. on Kāty. II, 5, 9, it is done by the sacrificer himself, who thereupon prepares the veda or bunch of sacrificial grass, tied in the middle, and cut straight at each end, and used for sweeping, &c. Cf. Kāty. I, 3, 21-22; II, 5, 9.
