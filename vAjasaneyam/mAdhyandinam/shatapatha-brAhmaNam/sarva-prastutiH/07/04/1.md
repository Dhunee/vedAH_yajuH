1. Being about to build Agni (the fire-altar), he takes him up into his own self; for from out of his own self he causes him to be born, and wherefrom one is born, suchlike he becomes. Now were he to build up Agni without taking him up into his own self, he would beget man from man, mortal from mortal, one not freed from sin from one not freed from sin; but when he builds up Agni after taking him up into his own self, he causes Agni to be born from Agni, the immortal from the immortal, the sinless from the sinless.

2. He takes him in (by muttering, Vāj. S. X III, 1), 'Within me I first take Agni,' he thereby first takes Agni into his own self;--'for increase of wealth, for healthy progeny, for vigorous manhood!' and hereby he takes all blessings to himself;--'and may the deities stand by me!' and hereby he takes all the gods to himself; and thus he takes into his own self all that he is about to generate from his own self. Having taken Agni

into his own self whilst standing, he builds him up sitting;--Agni is an animal: hence the animal, having received the foetus standing, gives birth after lying down.

8. And, again, why he puts down a lotus-leaf;--the lotus means the waters, and this earth is a leaf thereof: even as the lotus-leaf here lies spread on the water, so this earth lies spread on the waters. Now this same earth is Agni's womb, for Agni (the fire-altar) is this earth, since thereof the whole Agni is built up: it is this earth he thus lays down. He lays it down so as not to be separated from the truth: he thereby establishes this earth on the truth;--hence this earth is established on the truth; and hence the truth is this earth, for this earth is the most certain of these worlds.

9. [He lays it down, with Vāj. S.

He lays it down with a Svarāj verse, for self-rule (svārājya) belongs to the waters. Having 'settled' it, he pronounces the Sūdadohas [^egg_680] upon it: the significance of this has been explained.

this gold plate is yonder sun, for he shines over all the creatures here on earth; and 'rocas' (shine) they mystically call 'rukma' (gold plate), for the gods love the mystic: he thus lays down yonder sun (on the altar). It is golden, and round, with one and twenty knobs,--the significance of this has been explained. He puts it down with the knobs pointing downward; for the knobs are his (the sun's) rays, and his rays (shine) downwards.

13. And, again, why he puts it on the lotus-leaf. When Indra had smitten Vr̥tra, he, thinking that he had not laid him low, entered the waters. He said to them, 'I am afraid: make ye a stronghold for me!' Now what essence of the waters there was that they gathered upwards (on the surface), and made it a stronghold for him; and because they made (kar) a stronghold (pūḥ) for him, therefore it is 'pūshkara;' 'pūshkara' being what is mystically called 'push-kara' (lotus-leaf), for the gods love the mystic. Now when he puts it (the gold plate) on the lotus-leaf, he then establishes him (Agni) in that essence which the waters gathered together for him (Indra), and in that stronghold which they made for him.

 'The Brahman first born in front;' the Brahman doubtless is yonder sun, and he is born day by day in front (in the east);--'from the summit [^egg_682] he, the longing, overspread the shining,' the summit doubtless is the middle, the shining ones are these worlds, and the longing one is yonder sun,--he is the longing one inasmuch as he longed to be born; and in rising he overspreads [^egg_683] these (worlds) from the summit, from the middle;--'he (overspread) the nighest extents of the deep,' his nighest extents of the deep doubtless are the regions, for he (the sun) does extend nigh to them;--'the womb of the existent and of the non-existent did he overspread!' the womb of the existent and of the non-existent doubtless are these worlds; for both what exists and what does not exist is born from these worlds. He puts it on with a trishṭubh verse, for yonder (sun) is related to the Trishṭubh [^egg_684]. Having 'settled' it, he pronounces the Sūdadohas [^egg_685] verse upon it: the significance of this has been explained.

[^egg_682]: 366:1 'Sīmataḥ' would rather seem to mean 'from the boundary line,' but the author here takes 'sīman' in the sense of (sīmanta) 'hair-line, parting of the hair, crown of the head (Scheitel).'

[^egg_683]: 366:2 In the Sanskrit participial (or gerundial) construction, the relation between the primary and secondary notions is usually the reverse of ours,--thus 'he rises in overspreading.'

[^egg_684]: 366:3 It is usually with Indra that the Trishṭubh metre is connected--see part i, introduction, p. xviii; Śat. Br. IX, 4, 3, 7 (cf. VIII, 5, 1, 10)--the Trishṭubh being also the emblem of the nobility (III, 4, 1, 10).

41. The kārshmarya one he lays down on the right side, with (Vāj. S. XIII, 13), 'By Agni's fiery spirit I settle thee!'--that fiery spirit of his (Prajāpati's) which Agni then took and carried off to the south, he now puts back into him.--'Agni, the head, the summit of the sky, he, the lord of the earth, animates the seeds of the waters,' for Agni indeed is this (spoon). With a Gāyatrī verse (he performs),--Agni is Gāyatra: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus lays down that (spoon). It is filled with ghee, for ghee belongs to Agni: with his own share, with his own life-sap he thus gratifies him.

42. He then lays down the udumbara one on the

left (north) side, with (Vāj. S. XIII, 14), 'By Indra's vigour I settle thee!' that vigour of his (Prajāpati's) which Indra then took and went away to the north, he now puts back into him.--(Vāj. S. XIII, 15; R̥k S. X, 8, 6), 'Thou hast become the leader of the sacrifice, and of the sphere to which thou tendest with propitious teams; the light-giving head hast thou lifted to the sky; thy tongue, O Agni, hast thou made the bearer of the offering;'--Indra indeed is this (spoon). And as to its being a verse addressed to Agni, it is because it is the performance of Agni (the fire-altar);--and a trishṭubh one, because Indra is connected with the Trishṭubh; and Agni includes Indra and Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus lays it down. Moreover, all the gods are Indra and Agni, and Agni belongs to all the deities: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, with so much he thus lays it down. It is filled with sour curds, for sour curds belong to Indra: with his own share, with his own life-sap he thus gratifies him.

43. Indra and Agni indeed are those two arms of his (Prajāpati's): they join him with fiery spirit and vigour. Where he (the Sacrificer) touches (the ground with his arms), whilst viewing intently the gold man with his breast close to him [^egg_693], there he

[^egg_693]: 375:1 There seems to be considerable difference of opinion between Kātyāyana and Sāyaṇa regarding this point of the ceremonial. The gold man lies stretched out on his back with his head towards the east. According to Kātyāyana, XVII, 4, 10, he (the Sacrificer) is to lie down so as to cover the gold man, but without actually touching him with his breast, and at the extreme end of where the arms touch (the ground) he is to make two marks, where the spoons are then to be laid down with the bowl towards the east. Sāyaṇa,  on the other hand, explains--'Let the Adhvaryu lay down the two spoons close to the breast of the laid-down gold man. Having beheld (i.e. recognised)--or, whilst beholding (?)--that man, where-ever the laid-down pair of spoons reaches his breast there, having made a mark, let him lay down the two spoons: that part of the breast doubtless is the place of those two (spoons, or gods?) extolled as the arms.' Perhaps the text of this comment is somewhat corrupt. The ceremony is apparently intended to symbolise the identification of the Sacrificer with the sacrificial man, or the sacrifice itself: The Sacrificer lies down so as to rest on his forearms; the spoons being afterwards laid down on the marks left by the fore-arms (and naturally running in an easterly direction).--For Professor Weber's view, see p. 367, note 1.

 (the Adhvaryu) makes a mark and lays down those (spoons); for that is the place of those two (arms).

44. Now some lay them down sideways (from south to north), saying, 'Sideways run these two arms (of ours).' Let him not do so, but let him lay them with the bowl towards the front (east), for this Agni (altar) is built with the head towards the front; and, besides, in this way the arms are stronger. Separately he lays them down, separately he 'settles' them, and separately he pronounces the Sūdadohas verse on them; for separate are these two arms.

45. As to this they say, 'Let him make no arms to this (gold) man [^egg_694], lest he should cause him to be redundant; for these two spoons are (in lieu of) his arms.' Let him nevertheless make (him with arms), for those two spoons are (merely) after the manner of the two arms. Moreover, those two (arms of Agni) are wings; and whatever forms, whatever stomas, whatever pr̥shṭḥas, whatever metres he will be applying to that fire-altar, that will be the perfection, that will be the growth of those two: let him therefore make arms to that (gold) man.
