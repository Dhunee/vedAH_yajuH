1. Prajāpati produced creatures. Having produced creatures, and run the whole race, he became relaxed [^egg_593]. From him, when relaxed, the vital air went out from within: then his vigour went out of him. That having gone out, he fell down. From him, thus fallen, food flowed forth: it was from that eye on which he lay that his food flowed. And, verily, there teas then no firm foundation whatever here.

[^egg_593]: 312:1 Literally, fallen asunder, i.e. broken to pieces, or disjointed ('opened,' Delbrück, Synt. F. V, p. 385).

4. They spake, 'This Prajāpati is food: with thee for our mouth we will eat that food, and he (Prajāpati) shall be the food of us, having thee for our month.' He said, 'So be it!' Therefore the gods eat food with Agni as their mouth; for to whatsoever deity men offer, it is into Agni that they offer, since it is with Agni for their mouth that the gods thus took in the food.

11. He puts them on in the evening and morning, for the food both of the day and the night was flowing out. These same (ceremonies) should be (performed) during a whole year, for that Prajāpati whence those (substances) went out is the year: into that whole (Prajāpati) he thus puts all that (which belongs to him). And in whatever part of this (year) he should therefore [^egg_594] not do so, into that part of him (Prajāpati) he would not put that (which belongs therein). 'One must not even be a looker-on at the (building up of a fire) not carried about for a year,' Vāmakakshāyaṇa was wont to say, 'lest he should see this our father Prajāpati being torn to pieces [^egg_595].' He restores him so as to be whole and complete, and raises him to stand upright, even as the gods then raised him.

[^egg_594]: 314:1 Or, in whatever part of this (year) from henceforward he should not do so.

[^egg_595]: 314:2 It is very doubtful whether. this second clause of the oratio directa is really meant to belong to Vāmakakshāyaṇa's argument, or whether it is the author's own, in which case it has to be taken with what follows. 'Lest he should . . . pieces, he (first) restores him,' &c. That is, he is not to place him (Prajāpati) in an upright position, until he has been completely restored. The particular form of the participle qualifying Prajāpati (vicḥidyamāna) might seem to favour the former alternative; see, however, paragraph 23, antayoḥ saṁskriyamāṇayor, 'after the two ends have been perfected.'

12. This (terrestrial) world in truth is his (Prajāpati's) Gārhapatya (hearth); and what fire there is in this world that to him is the fire on the Gārhapatya. And what space there is between the Āhavanīya and the Gārhapatya, that is the air [^egg_596]; and that wind in

the air is for him the fire on the Āgnīdhrīya. The sky is his Āhavanīya (hearth), and those two, the sun and the moon, are the fire on the Āhavanīya. This then is indeed his own self [^egg_597].

13. The Āhavanīya truly is his head; and the fire which is on the Āhavanīya is that vital air of his in the head. And as to why it (the Āhavanīya) has wings and tail, it is because that vital air in the head has wings and tail [^egg_598];--the eye is its head, the right ear its right wing, the left ear its left wing, the vital air its central body [^egg_599], and the voice is the tail (and) the foundation (the feet): inasmuch as the vital airs subsist by eating food with speech (voice) [^egg_600], the voice is the tail, the foundation.

[^egg_598]: 315:2 That is, it is (like) a bird. The word 'prāṇa' might almost be rendered here by 'the living being.'

[^egg_599]: 315:3 In the text this is reversed, the head is the eye, the right wing the right ear, the left wing the left ear, the central body the vital air, which can scarcely be the construction intended by the author.

20. And as to those two formulas, they are that space between the Āhavanīya and the Gārhapatya, that air (-world), that body (of Prajāpati).

21. That same Anushṭubh, speech, is threefold. That fire, taking the form of the vital air, goes along with it (speech),--the fire which is on the Āhavanīya (altar) is the out-breathing, and yonder sun; and the fire which is on the Āgnīdhrīya is the through-breathing, and the wind which blows yonder; and the fire which is on the Gārhapatya is the in-breathing, and what fire there is here in this (earth-) world. And verily he who knows this makes up for himself the whole Vāc (speech), the whole vital air, the whole body (of Prajāpati).

22. Then that Br̥hatī (metre),--the two (verses) of thirty-two syllables: that makes thirty-two; then those two formulas: that makes thirty-four; Agni the thirty-fifth;--a metre does not vanish by a syllable (too much or too little), neither by one nor by two [^egg_606];--moreover, that (Agni) consists of two syllables: that makes thirty-six. The Br̥hatī consists of thirty-six syllables,--it is the Br̥hatī that that (Āhavanīya) pile thus amounts to; for whatlike the seed which is infused into the womb, suchlike (offspring) is born therefrom: thus in that he makes up that Br̥hatī (metre) in this (Gārhapatya hearth), thereby that (Āhavanīya) fire-altar amounts to the Br̥hatī.

[^egg_606]: 318:1 The same latitude in the computation of the number of syllables constituting a metre is conceded, Ait. Br. I, 6.

23. As to this they say, 'As the Gārhapatya is this (terrestrial) world, the Dhishṇya hearths the air, and the Āhavanīya the sky, and the air-world is not separated from this (earth-) world, why then, after building the Gārhapatya, does he build the Āhavanīya, and (only) then the Dhishṇyas?' Well, at first these two worlds (heaven and earth) were together; and when they parted asunder, the space which was between (antar) them became that air (antariksha); for 'īksha [^egg_607]' indeed it was theretofore, and 'Now this "īksha" has come between (antarā),' they said, whence 'antariksha' (air). And as to why, after building the Gārhapatya, he builds the Āhavanīya, it is because these two worlds were created first. Then, going back, he throws up the Dhishṇya hearths, just to prevent discontinuity of
