1. They now take the Nirr̥ti (bricks) from there. For, having built the Gārhapatya, the gods then ascended it,--the Gārhapatya being this (earth-) world, it is this world they ascended after completing it. They saw nothing but darkness not to be seen through.

3. Whilst meditating, they saw those Nirr̥ti bricks; they piled them up, and by them dispelled that darkness, evil; for Nirr̥ti (corruption, or destruction) is evil; and inasmuch as by them they dispelled Nirr̥ti, evil, these are Nirr̥ti's (bricks).

Now that same thing which the gods did, is done here: even now that darkness, that evil, has indeed been dispelled by the gods themselves; but when he now does this, it is because he thinks, 'I must do what the gods did.' And, besides, he removes, by means of these (bricks), whatever evil, whatever corruption there is; and because he removes by them evil, corruption (nirr̥ti), therefore these are Nirr̥ti's (bricks).

5. And, again, why they take these (bricks) of Nirr̥ti;--when the gods restored the relaxed Prajāpati, they cast him as seed into the fire-pan, the

In the course of a year they prepared for him this foundation, even this (terrestrial) world; the Gārhapatya (hearth) being this world: therein they generated him.

7. They measure a foot (square): he thus treads evil, corruption, under foot. They are unmarked; for whatever is not, that is unmarked (by characteristics): he thus makes evil, corruption to be non-existent. They get baked by (rice) husks, for husks belong to Nirr̥ti: by Nirr̥ti's own (objects) he thus performs Nirr̥ti's rite. They are black, for black was that darkness; and black in truth is Nirr̥ti (corruption).

8. With them they proceed towards that (southwestern) quarter, for that is Nirr̥ti's quarter: he thus places Nirr̥ti (corruption) in Nirr̥ti's quarter.

 And anywhere where there is a self-produced hollow [^egg_609] or cleft in the ground, he lays down those (bricks); for on whatever part of this (earth) there is a cleaving, or in whatever part of it plants are not produced, verily that part of it Nirr̥ti seizes upon: he thus places corruption in a (part) of the earth set aside for Nirr̥ti. Having put them in their places in a direction away from himself [^egg_610], he lays them down [^egg_611].

[^egg_609]: 321:1 Or probably, a barren spot, see p. 43, note 2.

[^egg_610]: 321:2 That is, whilst himself remaining north of the place, and facing the south, he puts them down in the direction from north to south.

[^egg_611]: 321:3 That is, he performs the formal ceremony of 'laying down (upadhāna)' whilst muttering the respective verses. In the present case the 'laying down' of the bricks is to be performed by him whilst muttering the formulas, but without touching the bricks themselves. The direction that the bricks are to be deposited in a direction 'away from him' perhaps refers to the 'laying down' instead of to the actual placing them.

The seat, the netting, the sling of the gold plate, and the two pads he throws down on the farther side (of the bricks),--the sling [^egg_612] is sacred to Nirr̥ti: from Nirr̥ti's sling he is thus freed. [He throws them down, with Vāj. S. XII, 65] 'The indissoluble bond which the divine Nirr̥ti hath fastened upon thy neck,'--indissoluble indeed for him who does not know this;--'that (bond) of thine I unloose, as from the middle of Āyus,'--Āyus [^egg_613] doubtless is Agni, and his middle (body) is that Gārhapatya which has been built;--not yet built is the Āhavanīya: hence whether a youth builds the altar, or an old man, he says 'as from the middle of Āyus;'--'now, being urged forward, eat thou this nourishment!' nourishment means food: thus, 'now, set free, eat thou this food.' With Trishṭubh verses (he performs this rite), for the Trishṭubh is a thunderbolt: it is thus with a thunderbolt that he repels evil, corruption.

[^egg_612]: 323:1 According to Sāyaṇa the sling of the gold plate is here singled out, because the other objects have necessarily been damaged by the hot fire-pan and are consequently thrown away as a matter of course.

[^egg_613]: 323:2 See III, 4, 1, 22. In the formula 'āyus' may rather have to be taken in the sense of 'life,' or 'vital power.' Mahīdhara takes 'na' in the sense of 'now (samprati),' instead of 'as.'
