Thus the joint unites; for, indeed, he makes (the Ukthya cup) the first of the second pressing (Soma feast), and the last of the first: that which belongs to the second pressing he makes first, and that which belongs to the first he makes last. Thus he interlocks them; whence these joints are interlocked: this one overlapping thus, and this one thus.

[^egg_706]: 293:2 At the end of the morning feast the Soma in the Ukthya bowl (sthālī) is poured into the Ukthya cup (pātra) in three portions; and part of each having been offered, the remaining juice is drunk by the Hotr̥'s assistants, viz. the Praśāstr̥, Brāhmaṇācḥaṁsin, and Acḥāvaka. Each of these potations is preceded by the chanting of an ājya-stotra, and the recitation of the ājya-śastra (see next page, note 2). But before the portion of the last-named priest is poured into his cup (camasa), fresh Soma-plants are taken down from the cart for the midday pressing; one half of the remaining Vasatīvarī water (or one third of the original quantity) being also poured into the Ādhavanīya trough.

5. In like manner at the midday pressing: (when)

the last cup has not yet been drawn therefrom for the Acḥāvāka priest, he pours (the remaining) one-third of the Vasatīvarī (into the Ādhavanīya). Thus the joint unites; for, indeed, he makes it the first of the second pressing, and the last of the first pressing [^egg_707]: that which belongs to the second pressing he makes first, and that which belongs to the first he makes last. Thus he interlocks them; whence these joints are interlocked: this one overlapping thus, and this one thus. And because his body is thereby held together, therefore this (graha) is his vital energy.

6. This (Ukthya graha) is the cow of plenty, Indra's special portion. At the morning feast he (the Adhvaryu) divides it for three songs of praise [^egg_708], and at the midday feast for three,--this makes six times, for there are six seasons, and the seasons mature all wishes here on earth: for this reason, then, this (libation) is the cow of plenty, Indra's special portion.

[^egg_708]: 294:2 Uktha, lit. 'recitation,' is the old term for 'sastra' (IV, 3, 2, 1 seq.). Regarding the three śastras of the Hotrakas, for the recitation of which the Ukthya graha is divided between those priests, see notes on IV, 3, 1, 25; 3, 3, 19.

7. He draws it without (reciting) a puroruc; for the puroruc is a song of praise, since the puroruc is a R̥c, and the song of praise is R̥c; and the libation is Sāman; and what other (formula) he mutters, that is Yajus. Formerly these same (puroruc verses) were apart [^egg_709] from the R̥cs, apart from the Yajus, and apart from the Sāmans.

9. And the reason why he draws this (graha) without a puroruc, is that the puroruc is praise, (being) a R̥c, and the song of praise is R̥c; and in that he divides it for recitations, thereby indeed it becomes possessed of a puroruc: hence he draws it without a puroruc.

[^egg_713]: 296:2 Praśāsanaṁ kuryāt. The same phrase occurs I, 9, I, 24, where I translated 'will ensure dominion,'--probably wrongly, though I am by no means sure of the correct meaning. Sāyaṇa there seems to take it in the sense of 'he bids (the gods grant his request), thus having chiefly his own interest in view'--'praśāsyante ’to devāḥ prārthyamānā iti praśāsanam parushaṁ syāt sākshāt svārthaparatvaṁ kuryād ity arthaḥ.' The Kāṇva text reads, 'let him not divide (the libation) with this (formula), for he who divides it thus--praśāsanaṁ kuryāt.' Perhaps he means to say, that by using that formula one would put oneself above the gods. At I, 9, 1, 14 'one would give orders (to the gods)' is probably the right translation.
