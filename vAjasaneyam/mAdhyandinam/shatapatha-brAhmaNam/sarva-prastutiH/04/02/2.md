1. The Āgrayaṇa graha, forsooth, is his self (body, trunk), and as such it is his all; for this self is one's all. Therefore he draws it by means of this (earth), for of her is the bowl [^egg_696], and with a bowl he draws this (libation); and this (earth) is all, as this

[^egg_696]: 288:2 Viz. inasmuch as the bowl is made of clay,--asyāḥ pr̥thivyāḥ sakāśāt sthālī bhavati utpadyate; Sāy. The Āgrayaṇa, Ukthya, and Dhruva grahas are drawn in a sthālī (pot or bowl).

graha is all: hence he takes it by means of this (earth).

5. And if the king (Soma) become exhausted, they extend him from out of that (bowl), make him issue therefrom; for the Āgrayaṇa is the body, and from the body all these limbs issue. Therefrom they draw at the end the Hāriyojana cup [^egg_697]: whereby the sacrifice is established at the end in this resting-place, the body (or its own self).

6. Then as to why it is called Āgrayaṇa. His speech which he restrains, on taking up that press-stone [^egg_698], spoke out again first at this (libation); and because it spoke out first (agre) at this (libation), therefore this is called the Āgrayaṇa [^egg_699].

[^egg_698]: 289:2 The Upāṁśusavana, cf. III, 9, 4, 6.

[^egg_699]: 289:3 The primary meaning seems to be 'firstling.' For the Āgrayaṇeshṭi, or offering of first-fruits, see part i, p. 369.

9. He now draws it from that (stream of Soma [^egg_701]) with (Vāj. S. VII, 19; Rig-veda I, 139, 11), Ye Gods, who are eleven in heaven, who are eleven on earth, and who are eleven dwelling in glory in the (aerial) waters: do ye graciously accept this sacrifice!--Thou art taken with a support: thou art Āgrayaṇa, a good firstling (sv-āgrayaṇa)!' Hereby he makes that speech of renewed vigour; whence he speaks therewith in a different way, while yet the same, in order to avoid sameness; for were he to take it with, 'Thou art Āgrayaṇa, thou art Āgrayaṇa,' he would commit (the fault of) sameness: therefore he says, 'Thou art Āgrayaṇa, a good āgrayaṇa.'

[^egg_701]: 290:1 The Āgrayaṇa is taken rather from two streams of Soma, viz. from that poured by the sacrificer from the Hotr̥'s cup into the Droṇakalaśa, and from another poured out by the Unnetr̥, and consisting either of Soma taken from the Ādhavanīya or, according to others, of the residue of the Upāṁśu libation, which had been temporarily kept in the Āgrayaṇa bowl (see p. 255, note 2), and has to be emptied by the Unnetr̥ into some other vessel, when that bowl is about to be used for the Āgrayaṇa libation. See Kāty. IX, 6, 15 comm.

10. 'Guard the sacrifice! guard the lord of the sacrifice!' whereby he utters freed speech, meaning to say, 'Protect the sacrifice! protect the sacrificer!' for the lord of the sacrifice is the sacrificer. 'May Vishṇu-guard thee with his might! guard thou Vishṇu!' whereby he utters freed speech--Vishṇu being the sacrifice--'May the sacrifice

protect thee with its power! protect thou the sacrifice!'--'Guard thou the Soma feasts all around!' whereby he means this very graha, because that belongs to all (three) Soma feasts [^egg_702].

11. Having then wrapped up (the bowl in) a fringed filtering-cloth, he utters 'Hiṅ!' Now that same speech (Vāc, fem.), being unsupported, lay exhausted. By means of the 'Hiṅ' the gods infused breath into that exhausted speech, for the 'Hiṅ' is breath, the 'Hiṅ' is indeed breath: hence one cannot utter the sound 'hiṅ' after closing his nostrils. By means of that breath she rose again, for when one who is exhausted takes breath, he rises again. And in like manner does he now infuse breath into the exhausted speech by means of the 'Hiṅ,' and through. that breath she rises again. Thrice he utters the 'Hiṅ,' for threefold is the sacrifice.
