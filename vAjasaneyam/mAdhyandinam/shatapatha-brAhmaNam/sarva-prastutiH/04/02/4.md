Formerly, indeed, both these grahas, the Dhruva and Vaiśvānara, were drawn; and even now one of them is still drawn, to wit, the Dhruva [^egg_715]. And if he acquire a knowledge of that (Vaiśvānara graha) either from the Karakas, or from anywhere else, let him pour it into the sacrificer's cup; but this (Dhruva graha he pours) into the Hotr̥'s cup [^egg_716].

The obvious meaning of this sentence is, 'hence the celebrator of the Agnishṭoma should be a Brahman,' or, perhaps, 'hence a Brāhman should celebrate the Agnishṭoma;' but I do not see how it can have that meaning here, without at least a double-entendre in the term 'agnishṭomasad,' Agnishṭoma in that case ('the praise of Agni') referring both to the sacrifice generally and to the chanting (stoma or stotra). See next note. My MS. of Sāyaṇa's commentary (from the library of the Mahārāja of Bikaner) has unfortunately an omission here.

[^egg_719]: 299:2 Viz. from the Sadas; 'niḥsarpet,' Kāṇva text. The verb sarp, 'to glide or creep,' is used technically of a peculiar noiseless mode of leaving (niḥsarp) the Sadas and returning thither (prasarp or pratisarp, see paragraph 10), and respectfully approaching the dhishṇya fires. If it has to be taken here in that sense, the first prohibition would seem to refer to the Hotr̥ (cf. Ait. Br. II, 21, where the question is argued whether or not the Hotr̥ ought to  proceed to the chanting-place with the other priests, and is decided in the negative); since the sacrificer, to whom the second prohibition refers (Kāty. IX, 6, 23), goes along with them, according to IV, 2, 5, 4. According to the commentary on Kāty. IX, 6, 33, in performing the sarpaṇa the priests and sacrificer should move along sitting at the morning feast; walking with bent bodies at the midday feast; and walking upright at the evening feast.

8. For, what part of him there is below the navel, that part of his self is this (Dhruva libation). Hence were he to slip away or discharge urine before the offering of this (libation), he would discharge the Dhruva (the firm, constant one): hence, lest he should discharge the Dhruva, he sits through the praise of Agni. This, indeed, applies only to the sacrificer [^egg_720], for this (libation) is part of the sacrificer's self.

They come to this cup of Soma, and he (the Adhvaryu) pours it out; whereby he lets loose the Gāyatrī: 'Made over to the sacrificer, may this Gāyatrī yield all his desires!' for this reason he pours it out.

[^egg_731]: 304:1 Viz. at the evening feast, when the Adhvaryu pours the Soma from the Dhruva-sthālī into the Hotr̥'s cup (paragraph 23).

VII, 25), 'The firm Soma I pour out--or, I take--with firm mind and speech: now may Indra make our people of one mind, free from enemies!' whereby he means to say, 'so that Indra may make these our creatures, the people, of one mind and free from enemies, for their happiness and glory and nourishment!'
