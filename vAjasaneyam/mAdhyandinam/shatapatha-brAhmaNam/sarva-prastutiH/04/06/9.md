1. Now, once on a time, the gods were sitting [^egg_1032] in a sacrificial session, thinking, 'May we attain excellence; may we be glorious, may we be eaters of food!' That same food, gained by them, wished to go away from them,--and, food being cattle, it was the cattle that wished to go away from them, thinking, 'It is to be feared lest they, being exhausted, may hurt us [^egg_1033]: how, indeed, will they deal with us?'

[^egg_1037]: 448:2 The Patnīśāla seems to be identical here with the Prācīnavaṁśa (see Kāty. XII, 4, 7), unless it be some shed or tent adjoining the latter, cf. Āpast. Śr. X, 5, comm. The sacrificial formula of the first offering seems to refer to the domestic hearth, the centre of the family life, as a source of joy and strength to the householder.

[^egg_1038]: 448:3 According to the Kāṇva text, the Adhvaryu makes the oblations; but if he does not know how to perform them (i.e. if they are not recognised by his school as belonging to the Adhvaryu's duties), the Gr̥hapati does so; and if he cannot do so, any one that knows them, may perform them. Regarding these oblations, and the order of the subsequent ceremonies, there is indeed considerable difference of opinion among the ritualistic authorities. According to Āśv. VIII, 13, 1-2 all of them offer, but only the first oblation is to be performed on the Gārhapatya, and the second on the Āgnīdhrīya. Lāṭy. III, 7, 8 seq., on the other hand, enjoins the Udgātr̥ to perform two oblations on the Gārhapatya; the first with the (somewhat modified) formula, assigned in our text to the second oblation, while the second oblation is to be made with 'Svāhā' simply. [The first of the above formulas is, according to that authority, to be used by them, when they touch the Udumbara post, see IV, 6, 9, 22.] The oblations completed, they are to proceed to the Āhavanīya, where the Udgātr̥s are to chant thrice the Sāman II, 1126 (?); after which they enter the Sadas to perform the Mānasa-stotra.

And the second he offers with, 'Letting the sucking calf to the mother,'--he means to say by this, 'letting the fire go to the earth;'--'a sucking calf drinking from the mother,'--he thereby means the fire sucking the (moisture of the) earth;--'may he maintain increase of wealth among us,--Hail!' increase of wealth is cattle: they thus secure cattle for themselves.

Similarly the Kāṇva text,--while touching the right shaft of the northern cart he sings thereon the Sāman 'the completion (success) of the session.'

In connection with this Stotra, an imaginary libation to Prajāpati-Vāyu is performed, everything connected with which, from the upākaraṇa (or introduction, on the part of the Adhvaryu, see p. 401, note 1) up to the bhaksha, or drinking of the cup by the priests, is done 'mentally' (that is, as would seem, by gestures merely).

[^egg_1047]: 452:4 That is, a discussion, or disputation, regarding the nature of the Brahman. According to Tāṇḍya Br. IV, 9, 14, as interpreted by the commentary, the performance consists rather in (or is followed by?) vituperative remarks on Prajāpati, whom they have now safely got into their power (allusion being made, for instance, to his criminal relations to his daughter; to his having created thieves, gad-flies and mosquitos, &c.); but this, it seems to me, is probably a wrong interpretation of the 'parivadanti' in the text, which may mean that 'they discourse' upon Prajāpati. So also Kāty. XII, 4, 21,  Prajāpater aguṇākhyānam, 'aguṇa' may have to be taken in the sense of 'nirguṇa' or 'nirguṇatvam' (unqualifiedness, unconditionedness), rather than in that of 'vice;' and it is worthy of note that the Prajāpati-tanu formulas, preceding the Brahmodya proper, consist chiefly in the enumeration of negative qualities. 'The twelve bodies of Prājapati are qualified as follows:--the eater of food and the mistress of food; the happy and glorious; the abodeless and dauntless; the unattained and unattainable; the invincible and irresistible; the unpreceded and unmatched.' Then follows the Brahmodya:--'Agni is the house-lord (gr̥hapati),' so say some: 'he is the house-lord of this world;'--'Vāyu is the house-lord,' so say some: 'he is the house-lord of the airy region;'--yonder (sun), forsooth, is the house-lord: he who burns yonder, he is the lord, and the seasons are the house. Verily, to whatsoever (sacrificers) he becomes the gr̥hapati, who knows that divine gr̥hapati, that gr̥hapati prospers, and they, the sacrificers, prosper: to whatsoever (sacrificers) he becomes the gr̥hapati, who knows the divine averter of evil, that gr̥hapati averts evil, and they, the sacrificers, avert evil! See Ait. Br. V, 25. According to Āśv., the Hotr̥ alone would seem to repeat the Brahmodya. The expression vākovākya (dialogue) apparently refers to the controversial form of this discourse. See also A. Ludwig, Rig-veda, III p. 390 seq.

 (the form of a) dialogue. For everything, indeed, is obtained, everything gained by them that sit through a sacrificial session,--they have performed with Yajus prayers: these have obtained so much, have acquired so much; they have recited R̥k verses: these have obtained so much, have acquired so much; they have chanted Sāmans: these have obtained so much, have acquired so much. But this has not been obtained, this has not been acquired by them, namely, the (theological) discussion, the sacred discourse: this is what they thereby obtain, what they acquire.

21. Having 'crept' up to the Udumbara post, they restrain their speech. Now, they who perform the sacrifice with speech, milk and suck out the

sacrifice; for sacrifice is speech. And previously to this, each of them sits speechless, strengthening his speech [^egg_1048], and with their speech thus strengthened and reinvigorated they perform the last day. But at this (disputation) the entire speech, thus obtained, becomes exhausted: that speech they all strengthen (by remaining) speechless, and with it thus strengthened and reinvigorated they perform the Atirātra [^egg_1049].

[^egg_1048]: 454:1 The construction of the text is quite irregular, and I am by no means certain whether 'tām eshām purā' should not be separated from what follows, and have the verbs 'viduhanti' and 'nirdhayanti' supplied after them,--That (speech) of theirs (they milk and suck out) before this. Each now sits speech-bound, strengthening his speech, &c.

Here is joy: here rejoice ye!' or, 'In me is stability, in me is (your) own stability! in me is joy: in me rejoice ye!' or both. See p. 448, note 3.

23. When the sun has set, they go out (of the Sadas) eastward, and sit down behind the Āhavanīya, in front of the Havirdhāna shed. Round them, sitting speechless, the Pratiprasthātr̥ carries the Vasatīvarī water [^egg_1051]. For whatever object they perform the session, therewith let them release their speech. For in olden times the R̥shis were wont to hold sacrificial sessions for certain objects,--'such is our wish: may that be fulfilled!' And if they be desirous of different objects, desirous of subjects, desirous of offspring, desirous of cattle,--

Thus they render their speech auspicious by means of the truth, and with that auspicious (speech) they pray for blessings,--'May we be abundantly supplied with offspring!'--thereby they pray for offspring;--'May we be abundantly supplied with men!'--thereby they pray for men;--'May we be abundantly supplied with food!' thereby they pray for prosperity.

Some, indeed, recite the Subrahmaṇyā each separately; but rather let the Gr̥hapati, or whomsoever the Gr̥hapati may call upon, recite the Subrahmaṇyā. Having desired an invitation to that (Atirātra feast), they put kindling-sticks on the fire [^egg_1053].
