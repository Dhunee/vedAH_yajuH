1. The Upāṁśu (graha), forsooth, is his out-breathing, the Upāṁśu-savana (stone) his through-breathing,

and the Antaryāma (graha) his in-breathing.

2. Now as to why it is called Antaryāma. That which is the out-breathing is also the in-breathing and the through-breathing. Now, in drawing the Upāṁśu (graha), he puts into him that out-breathing which tends away from him; and in drawing the

 Antaryāma, he puts into him that in-breathing which tends towards him. But this same in-breathing is confined within his self; and because it is confined (yam) within (antar) his self, or because these creatures are sustained (yam) by it, therefore it is called Antaryāma.

3. He draws it from inside the strainer [^egg_620], whereby he puts that in-breathing into him as one tending towards him, and that in-breathing of his is placed (or beneficial) within his self. And thereby also that Upāṁśu (libation) of his comes to be drawn from inside the strainer (i.e. from the pure Soma), for one and the same are the Upāṁśu and Antaryāma, since they are the out-breathing and in-breathing. And thereby, moreover, that (vital air) of his comes to be unceasing also at the other grahas.

[^egg_620]: 258:1 Antaḥpavitrāt, lit. from (the vessel or stream of Soma) which has the strainer inside it; the straining-cloth being spread over the Droṇakalaśa, into which the pressed-out Soma-juice is poured. The Petersburg Dictionary assigns to it the meaning 'the Soma within the filtering vessel' (see IV, 1, 1, 3). Perhaps it means 'from that which has a strainer between,' i.e. from the poured-out stream from which the libation is taken, and which is separated from the Droṇakalaśa by the straining-cloth.

4. Now as to why he purifies the Soma by means of a strainer (pavitra). When Soma had oppressed his own family-priest Br̥haspati, he restored to him (his property); and on his restoring it, he (Br̥haspati) became reconciled to him. Still there was guilt remaining, if only for having contemplated oppressing the priesthood.

6. Then as to why the grahas are drawn with the Upayāma [^egg_621]. Now Aditi is this (earth), and hers was that prāyaṇīya oblation, that Āditya rice-pap [^egg_622]. But that was, as it were, previous to the Soma feast: she desired to have a share along with the gods in the Soma feast, and said, 'Let there be for me also a share of the pressed Soma!'

[^egg_621]: 259:1 The term Upayāma, lit. 'foundation, substratum,' referring properly to 'that which is held under' while taking the libation, that is, the cup of the respective graha (and hence also identified with the earth, as the substratum of everything, cf. Sāy. on Taitt. S. I, 4, 3), has come to be applied likewise to the formula 'upayāmagr̥hīto ’si,' i.e. 'thou art taken with (or on) a support,' which is repeated at those libations before the formulas muttered while they are drawn into the respective vessels or cups (see par. 15). Haug, Transl. Ait. Br. p. 118 note, makes the following distinction between the graha (cup) and pātra (vessel) of the Antaryāma (and Upāṁśu) libation: 'The pātra is a vessel resembling a large wooden jar with but a very slight cavity on the top, in which the Soma-juice is filled. The graha is a small cup, like a saucer, made of earth, and put over the cavity of the Soma vessel, in order to cover the "precious" juice. The bottom of it is first put in water, and a gold leaf placed beneath it. There are as many grahas as there are pātras; they belong together just as cup and saucer, and are regarded as inseparable. The word graha is, however, taken often in the sense of the whole, meaning both graha and pātra.' I doubt, however, whether this distinction is in accordance with the old authorities. The graha vessels or cups are described as resembling the shape of a mortar. For other peculiarities, see IV, I, 5, 19. With some libations there is both a pātra (cup) and a sthālī (bowl).

8. And, again, why the grahas are drawn with the Upayāma. The Upayāma indeed is this (earth), since it is this (earth) that bears (upa-yam [^egg_623]) food here for cattle and men and trees; and the gods are above this, for the gods are in heaven.

[^egg_623]: 260:1 Lit. forms the support or basis for it. The sentence could also be translated, 'this earth doubtless is an upayāma (support), since she bears food.' Apparently he means to say that, as the gods are above, the food to he offered to them requires some support, something to 'hold it up' by for the gods to reach it.

9. The reason, then, why the grahas are drawn with the Upayāma, is that they are drawn by means of this (earth); and why he deposits them in the womb [^egg_624], is that this earth is the womb of everything, that it is from her that these creatures have sprung.

[^egg_624]: 260:2 This refers to the formula 'This is thy womb,' with which most libations, after being drawn, are deposited in their proper place on the khara until they are used for offering. See IV, 1, 3, 19.

24. Having returned (to the cart-shed), he deposits that (cup) with, 'Thee for the in-breathing!' for this is indeed his in-breathing. He deposits them [^egg_634] so as to touch one another; whereby he makes out-breathing and in-breathing touch one another, joins the out-breathings and in-breathings together.

[^egg_634]: 264:1 According to the Kāṇva text he is to place the Antaryāma cup on the south-east corner (dakshiṇārdhe) of the khara (see p. 255, n. 2); while, according to Kāty. IX, 2, I, both the Upāṁśu and Antaryāma are to be placed on the north-east corner, the former south of the latter. This arrangement, however, would scarcely agree with IV, I, 1, 27-28. The Upāṁśu-savana stone, doubtless, is to lie between the two cups, with its face towards the Upāṁśu.

25. Now these (cups and stone) repose without being moved until the evening Soma feast, whence men sleep here on earth; and at the evening Soma feast they are used again, whence these men, having slept, awake and are bustling and restless;--this, forsooth, is after the manner of the sacrifice, for the sacrifice is fashioned like a bird: the Upāṁśu and Antaryāma (grahas) are its wings, and the Upāṁśusavana (stone) its body.

26. They repose without being moved until the evening Soma feast. The sacrifice is spread along; but what is spread along moves, whence those birds fly spreading their wings, not drawing them in. At the evening Soma feast they are again used; whence

these birds fly drawing in their wings to fold them: this indeed is after the manner of the sacrifice.

27. The Upāṁśu, forsooth, is this (earth), for the Upāṁśu is the out-breathing, and breathing out one breathes upon this (earth). And the Antaryāma is yonder (sky), for the Upāṁśu is the in-breathing (up-breathing), and in breathing up one breathes towards yonder world. And the Upāṁśu-savana (stone) is the air, for the Upāṁśu-savana is the through-breathing, and he who breathes through (in and out), breathes through this air.
