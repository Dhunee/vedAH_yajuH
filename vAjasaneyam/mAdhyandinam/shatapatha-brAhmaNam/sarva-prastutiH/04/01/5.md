1. The Āśvina graha [^egg_653], forsooth, is his organ of hearing; hence in drinking it he turns (the cup) all round [^egg_654], since with that ear of his he hears all round.--Now when the Bhr̥gus, or the Aṅgiras, attained the heavenly world, Cyavana the Bhārgava, or Cyavana the Āṅgirasa, was left behind here (on earth) decrepit and ghostlike [^egg_655].

[^egg_653]: 272:3 The Aśvina graha is not actually taken at this time, but later on, after the oblation of drops and the chanting of the Bahishpavamāna stotra; see IV, 2, 5, 12. The reasons for inserting it here are given in parag. 15-16.

[^egg_654]: 272:4 Lit. 'he drinks it while turning it all round,' in accordance with the regular Sanskrit idiom. The Āśvina cup has three mouths, from which the Soma is drunk by turns. See Haug, Transl. Ait. Br. p. 132.

[^egg_655]: 272:5 On this legend, and its probable connection with that of Medea's cauldron, and the Germanic 'quecprunno' (Jungbrunnen, well of renovation), see A. Kuhn, 'Herabkunft des Feuers and des Göttertranks,' p. 11. For other translations, see Weber, Ind. Streifen, i. p. 13 seq.; Muir, O. S. T. v. p. 250 seq.; Delbrück ii. p. 121. For  another version, apparently more modern, of the same legend, found in the Jaiminīya (Talavakāra) Brāhmaṇa, see Professor Whitney, Proceedings Amer. Or. Soc. 1883, p. ix.

It then occurred to him, 'Surely, Cyavana, the Bhārgava, or Āṅgirasa, was left behind here, decrepit: him I (must) have somehow offended sorely, thence so great a calamity.' He called his tribe together. Having called the tribe together, he said, 'Who, be he cowherd or shepherd, has noticed anything here?'

In the Kāṇva text no mention is made of a pool (hrada), but merely of water to which the R̥shi is taken by his wife. I subjoin Professor Whitney's translation of the corresponding passage of the Jaiminīya Br. version: They (the Aśvins) said to him: "Sage, make us sharers in the Soma, Sir." "Very well," said he; "do you now make me young again." They drew him away to the śaiśava of the Sarasvatī. He said: "Girl, we shall all come out looking alike; do you then know me by this sign." They all came out looking just alike, with that form which is the most beautiful of forms. She, recognising him . . . . "This is my husband."

They drew this Āśvina cup for them; and those two became the Adhvaryu priests of the sacrifice, and restored the head of the sacrifice. Then, in the chapter of the divākīrtyas [^egg_661], it is explained how they did restore the head of the sacrifice. Hence this libation is drawn after the chanting of the Bahishpavamāna, for it was after the chanting of the Bahishpavamāna that they arrived.

Accordingly they transferred that graha for them to a former time, to those belonging to two deities: hence that graha is drawn in the tenth place, and is consecrated by Vashaṭ in the third place. And as to (the significance of) the Aśvins,--the Aśvins are manifestly [^egg_663] those two, heaven and earth [^egg_664], for it is those two

[^egg_662]: 276:2 One might expect the dual 'dvidevatyau,' as, besides the Āśvina graha, there are only two dvidevatya (belonging to two gods) grahas, viz. the Aindra-vāyava and Maitrā-varuṇa. See p. 266, note 3.

[^egg_663]: 276:3 Or, in their visible form (pratyaksham).

[^egg_664]: 276:4 See Muir, O. S. T. v, p. 234. The identification of the Aśvins with heaven and earth may have been suggested by Rig-veda VI, 70, 5,  where heaven and earth are called upon to mix the sweet drink, just as is the case with the Aśvins in the verse with which their libation is taken.

The vessel of the graha for the Aśvins is lip-shaped: this is its second shape, and therefore it belongs to two deities. And the reason why (this belongs to) the Aśvins is that the Aśvins are the heads (mukhya, viz. of the sacrifice), and this head (mukha [^egg_671]) is supplied with lips: hence the vessel of the Aśvina graha is lip-shaped.
