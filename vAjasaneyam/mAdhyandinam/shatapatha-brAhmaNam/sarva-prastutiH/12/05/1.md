1. They also say, 'If that performer of a long sacrificial session--to wit, he who (regularly) offers the Agnihotra--were to die whilst staying abroad, are they to sacrifice for him or not?' Now, some indeed think that (his Agnihotra) should be offered till they get home [^egg_534]; but let him not do so, for that (fire) does not submit thereto that they should offer to it, as for the burning of a dead body: it is rather to sacrifice and oblations that it submits, and, unable to endure it, it stays by him with impatience.

[^egg_534]: 197:1 Prof. Delbrück, Altind. Syntax, p. 430, takes 'āgantoḥ' in the sense,--'(thinking) he may still come;' but cf. Katy. XXV, 8, 9 with comm., according to which, in case of an Agnihotrin dying away from home, his people are--if the place of his death be somewhere near his home--to take the body there; but if it be far from home, they are to kindle a fire by 'churning' and burn the body, and having collected the bones and taken them home, they are there to perform the punardāha, or second cremation; and in either case the Agnihotra is to be performed regularly for the deceased, in the evening and morning, 'till the body or the bones arrive at the house (gr̥hāgamanaparyantam).' The force of 'iti' here evidently is,--(thinking,) 'we will do so until the home-coming.' Harisvāmin rightly resolves 'āgantoḥ' by 'ā āgantoḥ.'

2. And some, indeed, say, 'They (the fires) should lie in the very same condition, kept up (with fuel) but without offering being made on them;' but let him not do so, for that (fire) does not submit thereto that they should kindle it as for the burning of a dead body: it is rather to sacrifice and oblations that it submits, and, unable to endure it, it stays by him with impatience.

4. Let him rather proceed thus:--let him hid them seek for a cow suckling an adopted calf, and let him make offering with milk from her; for tainted is that milk which comes from a cow suckling an adopted calf, and tainted is the Agnihotra of one who is dead: by thus removing the tainted by the tainted, he becomes more glorious.

6. The procedure of this same Agnihotra (is as follows):--He causes her to be milked whilst eastward invested [^egg_535]; for, sacrificially invested, one gets (the Agnihotra-cow) milked for the gods, but in the case of the Fathers it is done thus.

[^egg_535]: 198:1 That is, wearing the Brāhmaṇical cord over the right shoulder, and under the left arm; instead of over the left shoulder, and under the right arm as is done at the sacrifice.

He does not take it off thrice, setting it down each time [^egg_537]; for were he take it off thrice, setting it down each time, he would be doing (what is done) for the gods: only once he takes it off drawing it downwards [^egg_538], and thus makes it to be sacred to the Fathers.

[^egg_537]: 199:1 When a spoonful of water has been added to the Agnihotra-milk, and the light of a burning straw again thrown on it, the pot is taken up three several times and put down each time further north on the hot ashes; see part i, p. 331, note 1.

[^egg_538]: 199:2 That is, down from the ashes--towards the south (where the Fathers, or departed ancestors, are supposed to reside),--whilst in the case of the ordinary Agnihotra he would be shifting the pot more and more upwards, or northwards. Cf. Kāty. XXV, 8, 10.

Cf. Kāty. IV, 14, 22-25.

But let him not do this; for if in that case any one were to say of him, 'Verily, this one has caused a cutting up in the middle of the village: the cutting up of him will speedily come about [^egg_543]: he will weep for his dearest;' then that would indeed be likely to come to pass.

[^egg_543]: 201:1 The burning of the dead body seems to be compared here with the cutting up of the victim which is done outside the sacrificial ground. Harisvāmin, indeed, takes 'grāma' here, not in the sense of 'village,' but in that of 'agnisamūha'--in the midst of the (set of) sacrificial fires--which, if it were possible, would certainly make the comparison even more striking.
