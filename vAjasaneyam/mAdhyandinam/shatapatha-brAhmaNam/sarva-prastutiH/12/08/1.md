1. Now, when Indra's energies, or vital powers, departed from him, the gods restored them by means of this very sacrifice. Both cups of milk and cups of Surā-liquor are filled: they thereby restore to him his energies, or vital powers. On the northern fire they offer (from) the cups of milk, and thereby provide him [^egg_591] with the bright liquor, with the Soma-drink.

[^egg_591]: 231:1 Or, cause him to prosper, render him successful by means of the liquor; MS. I. O. 311 reads 'samardhayanti.'

2. He (the Adhvaryu) offers (of the three cups of milk) with (Vāj. S. XIX, 32), 'By their devotions the buffalos quicken the sacrifice,'--the buffalos, doubtless, are the officiating priests, and devotion is sacrifice: through the priests he causes the sacrifice to prosper, and through the sacrifice the sacrificer [^egg_592];--'the barhis-seated one, supplied with Surā and goodly heroes,' supplied with Surā, indeed, is this barhis-seated sacrifice, to wit, the Sautrāmaṇī: by means of the barhis (the sacred grass on the Vedi), and the sacrifice, he causes him to prosper;--'they who bestow Soma,'--they thus bestow the Soma-drink upon him;--'with the deities in heaven,'--they thus place him with the deities in heaven;--'may we enjoy ourselves,'--the Soma-juice, indeed, conduces

[^egg_592]: 231:2 Or, perhaps, he provides the sacrifice with priests, and the Sacrificer with sacrifice. For obvious reasons the first two pādas of the verse have been transposed in the translation.

to joy, and so does the Surā-liquor: both the joy of Soma and the joy of Surā he thus secures;--'worshipping Indra with good hymns of praise!'--for the hymn of praise is food for the gods, and the sacrifice also is food: by sacrifice, by food, he thus makes him successful. Having sacrificed, they drink (of the milk), and thereby increase what is prosperous with him.

According to Kāty. XIX, 3, 17, and Mahīdhara on Vāj. S. XIX, 36, this is a fourth alternative of disposing of the liquor (in favour of the Fathers), the others being actual drinking, or smelling it, or hiring some one to drink it.

21. He offers, with (Vāj. S. XIX, 47), 'Two paths for mortals have I heard of, (that of the Fathers and that of the gods [^egg_606]),'--'two paths

[^egg_606]: 237:4 Not only is the second pāda of the verse omitted here (as also in MS. I. O. 311), but the construction of the first half of the verse is also rather peculiar, the most natural rendering being, 'Two paths of the Fathers have I heard of, (those) of the gods and of men.' The same verse occurs R̥ks. X, 88, 15 (with the reading 'dve srutī' instead of 'dve sr̥tī'), where Grassmann translates,-- 'Two paths there are, so the Fathers have told me, passable for gods and men;' whilst Ludwig takes it in the way just referred to. The above interpretation is that of Mahīdhara, who refers to Śat.-Br. I, 9, 2, 3; whilst Sāyaṇa (on Riks.) seems to take the two paths to be that of the Fathers and gods, and that of men (pitrīṇāṁ devānāṁ cotāpi martyānāṁ ca dve srutī dvau mārgau); though he afterwards calls them 'devayāna' and 'pitr̥yāṇa.'

indeed there are,' they say, 'those of the gods and of the Fathers,'--'thereon all that liveth here passeth,' for thereon, indeed, everything living here passes;--'what there is between the father and the mother,'--the father, doubtless, is yonder (sky), and the mother is this (earth): by means of these two he leads the Fathers to the world of heaven. He (the Sacrificer) alone drinks what is left from the offering [^egg_607]: to himself alone he thus takes prosperity, for milk is prosperity.

[^egg_607]: 238:1 That is to say, the milk which remains in the pot (ukhā), from which the milk used for the oblation was taken.

22. He drinks it, with (Vāj. S. XIX, 48), 'May this oblation be productive for me,'--for productive indeed it is, whether it be milk or Soma;--'possessed of ten heroes,'--the ten heroes, doubtless, are the vital airs: vital airs he thus takes to himself;--'possessed of all the troops,'--all the troops, doubtless, are the limbs: it is limbs he thus takes to himself;--'for well-being: breath-winning,'--the breath of life he thus wins;--'race-winning,'--a race (offspring) he thus wins;--'cattle-winning,'--cattle he thus wins;--'place-winning'--for it is for a place (in heaven) that he sacrifices: it is that he gains;--'safety-winning,'--the (place of) safety, doubtless, is the heavenly world: in the heavenly world he thus finally establishes himself;--'May Agni raise for me abundant offspring,

and bestow ye upon us food, milk, and seed!' it is to those (priests) who offer for him that he thus says, 'Bestow ye all this upon me!' By means of gold they cleanse themselves [^egg_608]; for gold is immortal life: in immortal life they thus finally establish themselves.

[^egg_608]: 239:1 Kāty. Śr. XIX, 3, 27, 'Over the cātvāla (pit) they cleanse themselves, with their wives, putting gold between;' that is to say, whilst the water is poured on their hands a piece of gold is held between, over which the water flows.
