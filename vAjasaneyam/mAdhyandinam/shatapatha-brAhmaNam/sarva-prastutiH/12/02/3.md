1. That year, doubtless, amounts to a Br̥hatī--,there are two shaḍahas (12) of winning days  [^egg_467]; the

[^egg_467]: 155:2 The term 'ārkshyat' is apparently a future participle of 'ā-arj,  hence 'calculated to procure, or win.' The Ait.-Br. has 'ākshyat' instead. The two Shaḍahas (or periods of six days), here counted as such days, would seem to include the six Svarasāman days, and the special named days scattered over the session (the opening and concluding Atirātra being apparently counted as one).

two, Pr̥shṭḥya and Abhiplava (12); the Go and Āyus, and the Daśarātra (ten days)--that makes thirty-six; for the Br̥hatī consists of thirty-six syllables, and by means of the Br̥hatī the gods strove to reach heaven, and by the Br̥hatī they did gain heaven; and in like manner does this one, by means of the Br̥hatī, now strive to reach heaven, and thereby gain heaven; he who knows this secures for himself whatever wish there is in the Br̥hatī.

2. And as to the Caturviṁśa day, it is the same as either the seventh or the ninth (day) of the Daśarātra [^egg_468] From out of the Abhiplava the Pr̥shṭḥya is formed, from the Pr̥shṭḥya the Abhijit,

[^egg_468]: 156:1 Caturviṁśa day is one in which the Caturviṁśa-stoma, or twenty-four-fold hymn-form, is exclusively used in the chanting of the Stotras. The one usually denoted by that term is the second day of the Gavām ayanam. In the Daśarātra, or ten-days’ period, there is, however, likewise a day in which the Caturviṁśa-stoma is used exclusively. That period consists of a Pr̥shṭḥya-shaḍaha (six days), three Cḥandoma days, and a final Atyagnishṭoma, called Avivākya. The three Cḥandoma days (i.e. days fashioned after metres) have assigned to them as their exclusive Stomas the twenty-four-fold, the forty-four-fold, and the forty-eight-fold hymn-forms respectively; the first of them, or the seventh day of the Daśarātra, being thus a Caturviṁśa day. But in the second half of the year's session the regular order of the days of the minor sacrificial periods--the Shaḍahas and Svarasāmans--is reversed, the last day being performed first; and according to this paragraph the same is optionally to be the case in regard to the three Cḥandoma days, the Caturviṁśa day being taken either first or last (see, however, parag. 9). Cf. also Haug, Ait.-Br., Transl., p. 347, note (where, in l. 3, read Daśarātra instead of Dvādaśāha).

from the Abhijit the Svarasāmans, from the Svarasāmans the Vishuvat, from the Vishuvat the Svarasāmans, from the Svarasāmans the Viśvajit, from the Viśvajit the Pr̥shṭḥya [^egg_469], from the Pr̥shṭḥya the Abhiplava, from the Abhiplava the Go and Āyus, and from the Go and Āyus the Daśarātra.

[^egg_469]: 157:1 Here, the order of Abhiplava and Pr̥shṭḥya followed in the first half of the year is reversed.

3. And that Mahāvrata is a winning-day, for its Stoma is the Pañcaviṁśa, and a metre does not collapse from (excess or deficiency of) a syllable--neither from one nor from two (syllables); neither does a Stoma by (an excess of) one hymn-verse [^egg_470].

[^egg_470]: 157:2 The author apparently claims for the pañcaviṁśa-stoma, or twenty-five-versed hymn-form, the same efficacy as for the caturviṁśa-stoma, the hymn-form of what is practically the first day of the sacrificial session (cf. Tāṇḍya-Br. XXV, 1, 1, where it is called Caturviṁśaṁ prāyaṇīyam), and which by the number of its stotriyā-verses, being that of the half-months in the course of the year (24), is supposed to represent the whole year; cf. Ait.-Br. IV, 52.

[^egg_471]: 158:1 See XI, 2, 5, 10 with note.  The Katurviṁśa day is, as it were, a promise on the part of the Sacrificer to perform the sacrificial session; whilst the Prāyaṇīya Atirātra not only represents the actual entering on the performance, but, as it were, implies the Udayanīya Atirātra (XII, 2, 2, 18).
