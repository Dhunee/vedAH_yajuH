1. Indra slew Tvashṭr̥'s son, Viśvarūpa. Seeing his son slain, Tvashṭr̥ exorcized him (Indra), and

brought Soma juice suitable for witchery [^egg_565], and withheld from Indra. Indra by force drank off his Soma-juice, thereby committing a desecration of the sacrifice. He went asunder in every direction, and his energy, or vital power [^egg_566], flowed away from every limb.

[^egg_565]: 214:1 'Exposed (liable) to witching,' Delbrück, Altindische Syntax, p. 401.

[^egg_566]: 214:2 'Vīrya' (virile power) is constantly used to explain 'indriya.'

2. From his eyes his fiery spirit flowed, and became that grey (smoke-coloured) animal, the he-goat; and what (flowed) from his eyelashes became wheat, and what (flowed) from his tears became the kuvala-fruit [^egg_567].

[^egg_567]: 214:3 The words 'kuvala, badara, and karkandhu' are the names of three varieties of the jujube, or fruits of Zizyphus Jujuba, for a description of which see the comm. on Kāty. Śr. XIX, 17 seqq. According to Stewart and Brandis’ Forest Flora of North-West and Central India (p. 87), 'this species varies exceedingly, in the shape and size of the fruits, the shape and tomentum of the leaves, and general habit;' 'the Zizyphi of North India want more investigation on the spot.' . . . 'Lakh is produced on this tree in Sindh, the Panjab, and Central India, The bark is used as dye-stuff; the root is a febrifuge in native pharmacy. A gum exudes from the trunk; and in Kangra a wild silkworm lives on the tree, the silk of which was much employed formerly to tie the barrel to the stock of the matchlock. But the tree is mainly cultivated for its fruit,  which is more or less globose on the wild and commoner sorts, and ovoid or oblong on the cultivated and improved kinds.'

He lay there dissolved. The gods gathered around him, and said, 'Verily, he was the best of us; evil has befallen him: let us heal him!'

the Sautrāmaṇī: and this is the (saving) nature of the Sautrāmaṇī--it saves the self from death, and repels evil for whosoever thus knows that (saving) nature of the Sautrāmaṇī. There are (for this sacrifice) thirty-three Dakshiṇās (presents to priests), for thirty-three were the gods who healed him: whence they say, 'Dakshiṇās are healing medicine.'
