1. Verily, this--to wit, the Aśvamedha--is the king of sacrifices. But, indeed, the Aśvamedha is the Sacrificer, (for) the sacrifice is the Sacrificer: when he (the priest) binds victims to the horse (or, at the horse-sacrifice), he then, indeed, takes hold [^egg_752] of the sacrifice at the sacrifice.

[^egg_752]: 298:3 Ārabhate prāpnoti, comm.; it might also be rendered by 'he enters upon the sacrifice.'

2. 'A horse, a hornless he-goat, and a Gomr̥ga [^egg_753]'

[^egg_753]: 298:4 This (and the identical passage XIII, 5, 1, 13) looks like a quotation, as if quoted from Vāj. S. XXIV, 1; where are  likewise found the references to the other victims and their places, in paragraphs 2-9. Possibly, however, the 'iti' may be used here with a kind of 'deiktic' force (cf. the similar use in XIII, 2, 8, 1); if, indeed, it does not simply refer to 'gomr̥ga,' i.e. 'the animal called Gomr̥ga.' (lit. 'bovine deer'), regarding which see note on XIII, 3, 4, 3.--Though the victims to be immolated on this day are first dealt with in this and the following Brāhmaṇas, their slaughter only takes place at the usual time at every Soma-sacrifice, viz. after the Sarpaṇam (XIII, 2, 3, 1 seqq.), the chanting of the Bahishpavamāna Stotra, and the drawing of the Āśvina-graha. On the present occasion these ceremonies are preceded by the drawing of the Mahiman cups of Soma (see XIII, 2, 11, 1 seqq.); whilst the chant is followed by the driving up of the victims, and the putting to of the horse, and the driving to the water, treated of in XIII, 2, 6, 1 seqq.

these they bind to the central stake: thereby, indeed, he (the priest) sharpens the front of his (the Sacrificer's) army [^egg_754], whence the front of the king's army is sure to become terrible.

[^egg_754]: 299:1 Harisvāmin takes this to mean that he makes the (sacrificial) horse, i.e. the king, alone the head of the army,--rājabhūtam apy aśvaṁ senāmukham ekaṁ karotīty arthaḥ.

3. A black-necked (he-goat), sacred to Agni, in front (of the horse) to its forehead [^egg_755]: the original (hall) fire he makes it, whence the king's hall-fire is sure to be (efficient) [^egg_756].

[^egg_755]: 299:2 According to the comments on Vāj. S. XXIV, 1, and Kāty. XX, 6, 4, a rope is wound round the horse's body in the same way as it is done with a bottle-gourd (lagenaria vulgaris), and it is to this rope that these so-called 'paryaṅgyāh (circumcorporal),' or victims surrounding the (horse's) body, would then be tied.

[^egg_756]: 299:3 The commentator explains 'bhāvuka' by 'sādhur bhavati;' and he adds that this is important inasmuch as numerous magic rites, such as rites for insuring success and averting evil (śāntikapaushṭika), and incantations (ābhicārika) are performed thereon. It is the name here assigned to this, the Āvasathya, fire, viz. 'pūrvāgni' or, original fire--with its secondary meaning 'front-fire'--which is seized upon by the author for symbolically identifying it with the victim fastened in front (or to the front) of the horse.

[^egg_757]: 300:1 Mahīdhara takes 'adhorāma' to mean 'white-coloured on the lower part of the body.'

But let him not do so; let him appease it with the Jāmadagna verses; for Jamadagni is Prajāpati, and so is the Aśvamedha: he thus supplies it with its own deity; let him therefore appease (the victims) with the Jāmadagna verses [^egg_767].

[^egg_765]: 302:2 Or, 'what Āprīs (appeasing verses) is he to pronounce over them?' These verses are pronounced as the offering-formulas (yājyā) at the fore-offerings of the animal sacrifice. See part ii, p. 185, note 1.

15. Now some make the invitatory-formulas and the offering-formulas (to be pronounced) separately for the 'paryaṅgyas,' saying, 'For these we find (formulas)--for the others, on account of not finding any, we do not use them [^egg_768].' Let him not do so;

[^egg_768]: 302:5 The commentator takes this to mean that, inasmuch as these paryaṅgyas--here improperly including the horse itself and the two other victims of Prajāpati at the central stake--are assigned to commonly invoked deities, formulas relating to these would easily  be found; whilst in the case of the other twelve victims tied to the central stake (see p. 301, note 3), as well as those of the other stakes--though they, too, are assigned to definite deities--some of their deities (as in the case of three a year and a half old heifers assigned to Gāyatrī, Vāj. S. XXIV, 21), are such as to make it difficult to find suitable formulas for them:--eteshām aśvādīnāṁ prajāpatvādikā yājyānuvākyās tāḥ kim iti na pr̥thak kurmaḥ; itareshāṁ rohitādīnāṁ na vindāmaḥ, tryavayo gāyatryādayo devatās taddevatyāś ca durlabhā lakshaṇopetā yājyānuvākyā ity abhiprāyaḥ.

for the horse is the nobility (chieftain), and the other animals are the peasantry (clan); and those who do this really make the peasantry equal and refractory to the nobility; and they also deprive the Sacrificer of his vital power. Therefore the horse alone belongs to Prajāpati [^egg_769], and the others are sacred to the gods: he thus, indeed, makes the peasantry obedient and subservient to the nobility; and he also supplies the Sacrificer with vital power.

[^egg_769]: 303:1 The invitatory-formula and offering-formula are, however, pronounced once for the 'paryaṅgyas' (including the horse) in common, whilst a second pair of formulas are used for the other victims in common.

The slaughtering-knife of the horse is made of gold, those of the 'paryaṅgyas' of copper, and those of the others of iron; for gold is (shining) light, and the Aśvamedha is the royal office: he thus bestows light upon the royal office. And by means of the golden light (or, by the light of the gold), the Sacrificer also goes to the heavenly world; and he, moreover, makes it a gleam of light shining after him, for him to reach the heavenly world.
