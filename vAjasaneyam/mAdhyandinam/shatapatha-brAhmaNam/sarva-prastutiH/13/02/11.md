1. Prajāpati desired, 'Would that I were great, and more numerous!' He perceived those two Mahiman (greatness) cups of Soma at the Aśvamedha; he offered them; and thereby, indeed, became great and more numerous: hence whosoever should desire to become great, and more numerous, let him offer up those two Mahiman cups of Soma at the Aśvamedha; and he indeed becomes great and more numerous.

2. He offers them on both sides (before and after) the omentum;--the Aśvamedha, doubtless, is the Sacrificer, and that Mahiman (cup) is the king: it is with royal dignity he thus encompasses him on both sides. Some gods have the svāhā-call ('hail') in front, and the other gods have the svāhā-call behind [^egg_834]: it is them he thus gratifies. With 'Hail

[^egg_834]: 327:2 The formula uttered whilst the first Mahiman cup is offered runs thus (Vāj. S. XXIII, 2): 'What greatness of thine there hath  been in the day and the year; what greatness of thine there hath been in the wind and the air; what greatness of thine there hath been in the heavens and the sun, to that greatness of thine, to Prajāpati, hail, to the gods!' whilst that of the second Mahiman cup runs thus (XXIII, 4): 'What greatness of thine there hath been in the night and the year; what greatness of thine there hath been in the earth and the fire; what greatness of thine there hath been in the Nakshatras (lunar asterisms) and the moon, to that greatness of thine, to Prajāpati, to the gods, hail!' cf. XIII, 5, 2, 23; 3, 7.
