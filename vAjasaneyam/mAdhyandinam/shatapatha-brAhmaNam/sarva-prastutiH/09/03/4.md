1. He then offers the Vājaprasavīya [^egg_379] (set of fourteen libations),--'vāja' (strength, sustenance) means food (anna): it thus is an 'anna-prasavīya' for him, and it is food he thereby raises (pra-sū) for him (Agni).

[^egg_379]: 223:2 That is, oblations capable of promoting or quickening strength (or food,--vāja); see part iii, p. 37 (where read Vājaprasavīya). While the formulas of the first seven of these oblations are the same as those used for those of the Vājapeya (see V, 2, 2, 5-11), the formulas of the last seven of these oblations are Vāj. S. XVIII, 30-36 (for the first of which, being the same as IX, 5, see VI, 1, 4, 4).

Let him set aside one of these kinds of food, and not eat thereof as long as he lives. With an udumbara (ficus glomerata) cup [^egg_381] and an udumbara dipping-spoon (he offers): the significance of these two has been explained. They are both four-cornered,--there are four quarters: he thus gratifies him with food from every quarter, and by means of food from every quarter he thus consecrates him.

5. And, again, as to why he performs the Vājaprasavīya;--he thereby gratifies those same deities who have been consecrated by this very rite of consecration by which he is now about to be consecrated, and, thus gratified by offering, they grant him permission (to perform) this rite of consecration, and, permitted by them, he becomes consecrated; for only he becomes king whom the (other) kings allow to assume the royal dignity, but not he whom

they do not (allow to do so). Thus when he offers in the fire he consecrates Agni, and when he offers to these deities, he gratifies those gods who rule over this consecration ceremony.

They were indeed consecrated on this occasion by all the rites of consecration; and in like manner is the Sacrificer on this occasion consecrated by all the rites of consecration.

[^egg_382]: 225:1 In the same way as, at the Rājasūya, six Pārtha oblations were offered before, and as many immediately after, the Consecration ceremony, or 'anointment' (see part iii, p. 8 1 seq.), so also on the present occasion, except that, between the first six Pārthas and the consecration ceremony, the Vājaprasavīya set, referred to in the preceding paragraphs, is inserted.

7. Now these Pārtha (oblations) are the Vājaprasavīya of the Rājasūya; and by offering these (oblations) he is consecrated by the Rājasūya; and the first seven of the succeeding fourteen (Vājaprasavīya oblations) are the Vājaprasavīya ceremony of the Vājapeya [^egg_383]: thus, by offering these he is consecrated by the Vājapeya. And what other seven there are, they belong to Agni (or, the Agnicayana): by offering these, he is consecrated by the Agni-consecration.

emperor [^egg_384]: hence after performing the Vājapeya, one could not perform the Rājasūya,--it would be a descent, just as if one who is emperor were to become king.
