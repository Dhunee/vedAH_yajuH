1. Indra saw this seven-versed (hymn, suitable) for making good what is deficient [^egg_506], for reducing what is redundant, and for perfecting what is imperfect. And, indeed, after building the fire-altar, one is (still) apt to get into trouble, or to stumble, or what not. Now, when Śyāparṇa Sāyakāyana heard this, he ventured upon this performance.

[^egg_506]: 274:1 Viz. in the building of the fire-altar; literally, for the obtainment of the deficient.

3. Thus, when he reverently stands by (the altar) with this (hymn), everything is thereby made good [^egg_507] for him that, knowing or unknowing, he either does in excess, or does not carry to the end, in this building of the altar--in short, whatever was not secured for him. And whatever wish there is in that anushṭubh verse [^egg_508], that he secures even now; and, moreover, he thereby keeps off the fiends, the Rakshas, from this sacred work, and they do not wreck him, whilst uttering imprecations. Wherefore one who knows this may readily build a fire-altar even for an enemy, for he is able to gain the better of him.

[^egg_507]: 275:1 Literally, obtained.

[^egg_508]: 275:2 Viz. the first of the seven verses (R̥g-veda III, 37, 1).

8. It is (a hymn) of seven verses,--the fire-altar consists of seven layers, (and there are) seven seasons, seven regions, seven worlds of the gods, seven stomas, seven pr̥shṭḥa (sāmans), seven metres, seven domestic animals, seven wild ones, seven vital airs in the head, and whatever else there is of seven kinds, relating to deities and relating to the self,--all that he thereby secures. They become equal to the Anushṭubh [^egg_513], for the Anushṭubh is speech, and it is by speech that he secures for him (Agni) all that which is not yet secured for him.

[^egg_513]: 277:1 The seven verses consist of two Gāyatrīs (twenty-four syllables each), four Trishṭubhs (forty-four each), and one Anushṭubh (thirty-two syllables). Whilst the two Gāyatrīs are sixteen syllables short of two Anushṭubhs, the four Trishṭubhs have forty-eight syllables in excess of four Anushṭubhs. Hence the seven verses consist of 8 × 32 syllables, or eight Anushṭubhs.

whatsoever is not yet secured for him; and thus, moreover, the two deities [^egg_514] receive the same (amount) for their share.' Let him, however, not do so, for surely those seven (verses) are (equal to) eight anushṭubh (verses), and thus he even therein obtains whatever wished-for object there is in the eight-versed (hymn).
