1. He then offers the Rāshṭrabhr̥t (realm-sustaining) oblations;--the realm-sustainers, doubtless, are the kings, for it is they that sustain realms. These deities, indeed, have been consecrated by this same consecration ceremony by which he (the Sacrificer) is now to be consecrated: it is them he thereby gratifies, and thus gratified by offering, they grant him permission (to perform) this consecration ceremony, and, permitted by them, he is consecrated; for only he becomes king whom the (other) kings allow (to assume) the royal dignity, but not he whom they do not (allow to assume it). And inasmuch as the kings sustain realms, and these gods are kings, therefore Realm-sustaining (oblations are performed).

From Prajāpati, when dismembered, couples went forth, in the form of Gandharvas and Apsaras; and he, having turned into a chariot, enclosed them, and having enclosed them, he took them to himself and made them his own; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer), thereby enclosing them, take them to himself and make them his own.

4. He makes offering to the Gandharvas and Apsaras, for in the form of Gandharvas and Apsaras they went forth (from Prajāpati). But the Gandharvas and Apsaras also busy themselves with sweet scent (gandha) and beauteous form (rūpa [^egg_389]), whence if any one goes to his mate he cultivates sweet scent and a beautiful appearance.

[^egg_389]: 230:1 This is apparently intended as an etymological explanation of the two names; Apsaras being taken as derived from 'apsas,' in the sense of 'beauty.' Cf. Weber, Ind. Stud. XIII, p. 135, note 3.

To a single male he makes offering, and to many females, whence even a single man has many wives. To the male (deity) he makes offering both with the Vashaṭ-call and the Svāhā-call, to the female (deities) only with the Svāhā: he thereby endows the male pre-eminently with power.

'The law-upholding, law-abiding Agni is the Gandharva--may he protect this our priesthood and nobility: to him Svāhā! Vāṭ!' is to be uttered first, and the first oblation to be offered at the call 'Vāṭ,' i.e. Vashaṭ, 'may he (Agni) carry it (to the gods)!' Then that part relating to the female deities is uttered, after which the second oblation is offered. In the same way the other five formulas are to be treated. See Mahīdhara's remarks on the present formula.

Whether the author of the Brāhmaṇa really connects it with 'bhuj (bhunakti),' 'to enjoy, benefit' (instead of with 'bhuj,' 'to bend'); or whether the explanation is merely meant as an etymological play of words, is not clear.
