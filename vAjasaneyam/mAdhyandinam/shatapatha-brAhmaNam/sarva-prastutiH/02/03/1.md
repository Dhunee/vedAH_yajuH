1. The Agnihotra, doubtless, is the Sun. It is because he rose in front (agre) of that offering [^egg_740], that the Agnihotra is the Sun.

[^egg_740]: 327:1 Apparently an etymological play on the word agnihotra = agre hotrasya, cf. II, 2, 4, 2.

Then, as to his taking out the Āhavanīya (from the Gārhapatya) before the setting of the sun;--the rays, doubtless, are all those gods; and what highest light there is, that, indeed, is either Prajāpati or Indra. Now all the gods approach the house of him who performs the Agnihotra: but whosesoever (offering) they approach before the fire has been taken out, from that the gods turn away, and he fails in it; and after the failure of that (offering) from which the gods turn away, people say, that, whether one knows it or not, the sun went down on account of that (fire) not having been taken out.

Although that which lasts for twelve years is indeed limited, this (Agnihotra) is nevertheless unlimited, since, when one has offered in the evening, he knows that he will offer in the morning; and when one has offered in the morning, he knows that he will again offer in the evening. Hence that Agnihotra is unlimited, and in consequence of this its unlimitedness, creatures are here born unlimited.

He then crouches down [bending his right knee, and looking eastwards, by the north-west corner of the Āhavanīya], puts the billet on [the centre of] the fire, and makes the first libation (pūrvāhuti) on the burning stick (see the formula, par. 30. The sacrificer, as usual, pronounces the dedicatory formula, viz. 'This to Agni!' and, 'This to Sūrya!' respectively). Thereupon he lays down the ladle on the kūrca [a grass-bunch, placed behind the Āhavanīya fire-place, to serve as a seat, and to wipe the hands on; according to others, a flat piece of Varaṇa wood], then takes it up again and silently makes the second libation (uttarāhuti) on the north part of the fire. Kāty. IV, 14, 12-17 with Schol.

For, were he to put it down beside (the fire), it would be as if, in taking food to somebody, one were to put it down on one's way thither. But when (he makes the libation) without previously putting it down, it is as if, in taking food to somebody, one puts it down only after taking it to him. The second (libation he then makes) after putting it down: he thereby makes these two (libations) of various vigour. Now these two: libations are mind and speech: hence he thereby separates mind and speech from each other; and thus mind and speech, even while one and the same (samāna), are still distinct (nānā).

On this point Yājñavalkya said, 'It (the Agnihotra) must not be looked upon as a (havis-) sacrifice, but as a domestic sacrifice (pākayajña); for while in any other (havis-)sacrifice he pours into the fire all that he cuts off (from the sacrificial dish and puts) into the offering spoon,--here, after offering and stepping outside [^egg_752], he sips water and licks out (the milk); and this indeed (is a characteristic) of the domestic offering.' This then is the animal

[^egg_752]: 333:3 Utsr̥pya is variously explained by the commentators here and on Kāty. IV, 14, 27, as 'having gone out,' or 'having slowly moved forward,' or 'having risen,' or 'having poured out (the milk).'

characteristic [^egg_753] of that (Agnihotra), for the domestic offering pertains to beasts (or cattle).

[^egg_753]: 334:1 Paśavyaṁ rūpam,--that is to say, its relation to the paśu or animal sacrifice; and hence also to the iḍā at the haviryajña; cf. I, 7, 4, 19.

Moreover, this second libation is made in order to effect a pairing, for a couple forms a productive pair.

Such, indeed, is the case with those who offer after sunrise; for when the sun sets then Agni is the light, and when the sun rises then Sūrya is the light. Here no offence is committed on his (the sacrificer's) part; but an offence is indeed committed where offering is not made distinctly to that deity (viz. Agni or Sūrya resp.), which is the deity of the Agnihotra.

[^egg_761]: 336:2 The Kāṇva has,--Now they say, 'In the evening they offer Agni in Sūrya, and in the morning they offer Sūrya in Agni.' But see the formulas (par. 30), where 'light' is to be taken as Sūrya and Agni respectively.

 He says [^egg_762], 'Agni is the light, the light is Agni, Svāhā!' and not, 'To Agni Svāhā!' and in the morning, 'Sūrya is the light, the light is Sūrya, Svāhā!' and not, 'To Sūrya Svāhā!'

[^egg_762]: 337:1 Here the Kāṇva text begins a new paragraph. The author's object seems to be to show that those who offer the Agnihotra after sunrise, commit a mistake in not offering to Sūrya unmistakably; for while before sunrise, Sūrya is still reposing in Agni, and the oblation, in being poured into the fire, is consequently made to Sūrya directly, those offering after sunrise should rather use the formula 'To Sūrya Svāhā!'
