1. Now when Prajāpati, in creating living beings, created Agni, the latter, as soon as born, sought to burn everything here: and so everybody tried to get out of his way [^egg_770]. The creatures then existing sought to crush him. Being unable to endure this, he went to man.

[^egg_770]: 342:1 Ity ābilam āsa, i.e. 'there was a (general rush) to a hole,' (or perhaps 'to the outlet.')

But those that are on the other side of him are the gods, and they are therefore immortal. It is by the rays (or reins, thongs, raśmi) of that (sun) that all these creatures are attached to the vital airs (breaths or life), and therefore the rays extend down to the vital airs.

II, 3, 4, 39); when the sun has half disappeared or until it becomes visible; cf. Āśval. Gr̥hyas. XX, 3, 7] passes between the Gārhapatya and Dakshiṇa fires, or south of them,  [enters the Āhavanīya house by the east door], circumambulates the fire from right to left (apadakshiṇam), and sits down in his place (south of the Āhavanīya fire and altar). The same circumambulation is performed by the wife, who thereupon sits down in her place, south-west of the Gārhapatya.

between (it and) the Gārhapatya (to his seat). For the gods do not know (this) man [^egg_773]; but when he now passes by them between (the fires), they know him, and think, 'This is he that now offers to us.' Moreover, Agni (the fire) is the repeller of evil; and these two, the Āhavanīya and Gārhapatya, repel the evil from him who passes between them; and the evil being repelled from him, he becomes a very light in splendour and glory.

[^egg_773]: 345:1 Or, 'the gods are not aware of (this) man' (na vai devā manushyaṁ viduḥ). The gods are supposed to be assembled around the altar; see I, 3, 3, 8.

[^egg_774]: 345:2 I do not understand this, there being no door on the north side of the Āhavanīya fire-house. According to the commentator this passage is directed against those who make the sacrificer betake himself to the Āhavanīya from (or along) the south; and he quotes the words 'dakshiṇena vā' from Kātyāyana, apparently IV, 13, 12, where it is said that the sacrificer, in going to the Āhavanīya, has to pass between the two western fires, 'or south of them.'
