Here also two days were, as a rule, required for the performance, both at full and new moon; but while, at the ordinary sacrifice,

At full moon some authorities add a special ishṭi to Indra Vimr̥dh ('the Averter of evil'). The new-moon performance concludes with libations of whey to the divine coursers (the horses of the gods); and, optionally, with an ishṭi to Āditya.

The performance of the Dākshāyaṇa sacrifice was held to be obligatory only for a period of fifteen years (see XI, 1, 2, 13), whereas the ordinary new and full-moon offerings had to be performed for double that period from the setting up of the sacred fires. Nay, even the daily performance of it with certain modifications, for a whole year, was supposed to acquit the householder of any further obligation in this respect; his sacrificial duties being henceforth limited to the performance of the Agnihotra, or morning and evening libations. The daily performance of the Dākshāyaṇa is so regulated that an afternoon and following forenoon are alternately assigned to the two days' ceremonies of the ordinary fortnightly Dākshāyaṇa sacrifice.

2. Now he was indeed Daksha: and because

he sacrificed in the beginning with this sacrifice, it is called Dākshāyaṇa-sacrifice. Some, however, call it the Vasishṭḥa-sacrifice; for he (Prajāpati) is indeed vasishṭḥa (the best) [^egg_833], and after him they call it. He sacrificed with that sacrifice; and what race, what prosperity of Prajāpati was then produced through his performing that sacrifice, that same race he procreates, that same prosperity he obtains, whosoever, knowing this, performs that sacrifice: let him therefore perform that sacrifice.

Now were he also here (at the full-moon offering) to mix together (the sweet and sour milk), he would commit a repetition and cause a quarrel (between the respective gods) [^egg_849]. Having collected that (Soma or moon) from the waters and plants, he causes him to be born from out of the oblations; and on being born from the oblations, he is visible in the western (sky).

[^egg_849]: 381:2 At the new-moon offering of the Dākshāyaṇa, the sānnāyya or payasyā offered to Mitra and Varuṇa is prepared in the ordinary way (as at the new-moon ceremony), by fresh (boiled or un-boiled) milk being added to the sour milk of the preceding night's milking. At the full-moon offering, on the other hand, the sour and sweet milk remain separate, and constitute two different havis, or sacrificial dishes, dedicated to Indra. The terms san-nī ('to bring together') and sānnāyya are here likewise applied to the offering of the separate substances.

21. It is through union that he produces him: the curds (payasyā, fem.) are female, and the whey is seed. Now what is produced by union is (produced) properly: hence he thereby produces him by a productive union; and therefore there is an offering of curds.

22. He then offers the whey [^egg_850] to the (divine) Coursers. Now the Coursers are the seasons, and the whey is seed: and thus the seed is cast properly, and the seasons bring forth the seed so cast in the form of these creatures. This is why he offers the whey to the Coursers.

[^egg_850]: 382:1 Before the oblations of curds are made, the whey is poured off into a vessel (then optionally sprinkled with butter), and placed on the utkara, or heap of rubbish. After the stalk of grass has been thrown into the fire (see I, 8, 3, 19), or after the dismissal of the spoons (I, 8, 3, 27), the Adhvaryu takes the whey and sprinkles the barhis (the grass covering on the altar) with it. He then pours the remaining whey into the juhū spoon and calls on the Hotr̥ to recite the invitatory prayer to the Coursers. Thereupon he betakes himself with the spoon to the north of the fire, calls on the Hotr̥ for the offering-formula, and at the two concluding Vashaṭs pours some of the whey into the east part of the fire. He then sits down and sprinkles the whey on the fire according to the several quarters, beginning in the east, and moving around from left to right (pradakshiṇam), with the respective texts, Vāj. S. VI, 19 b-e; after which he makes two more libations in the centre and east part of the fire, with VI, 19 f and g.

23. He offers, as it were, behind the sacrifice: for it is from behind that the male approaches and impregnates the female. He first offers in the east. With 'O Agni, accept . . . !' he repeats the Vashat,--this is in lieu of the Svishṭakr̥t; and (the latter) [^egg_851] he offers in the east.

25. Five partake of that (whey remaining in the spoon),--viz. the Hotr̥, the Adhvaryu, the Brahman, the Āgnīdhra, and the Sacrificer; for five are the seasons, so that the characteristic nature of the seasons is thereby obtained; and the seed that is cast is firmly implanted in the seasons. The sacrificer partakes of it first, thinking, 'May I first obtain seed!' But also last (he partakes of it) [^egg_854], thinking, 'May seed remain in me last of all!' By saying, 'Invited,--invite thou [^egg_855]!' they make it (the whey to resemble) the Soma.

[^egg_854]: 383:2 The author does not express himself quite clearly. The sacrificer is to partake of the whey before the priests and also (or, as an alternative) after them. According to Kāty. IV, 4, 26-27, the sacrificer is to eat either last of all, or first and last. The Kāṇva text has: Prathamo yajamāno bhakshayati prathamo retaḥ parigr̥hṇāmīty athottamo mayy uttamaṁ retaḥ pratitishṭḥād iti,--accordingly he is to eat first and last.

[^egg_855]: 383:3 Each of them, in his respective order, takes the spoon, calls on the others in the same order with 'O sacrificer (Hotr̥, Adhvaryu, &c.) invite!' Their permission having been given by 'Invited (thou art)!' he then takes some of the whey, with one of the texts: 'I eat thee, the courser (or whey, vāginam) of the seasons, the coursers!' 'I, the courser (or, mighty one) eat, invited, of the invited, to the whey.' 'May I be a racer in the race!' Kāty. IV, 4, 13-15.
