1. Now Varuṇa established this (fire), being desirous of sovereignty. He obtained sovereignty; and, accordingly, whether one (who has established the fires) knows (this) or not, they call him 'king Varuṇa.' Soma (established the fire), being desirous of glory. He became glorious, and, accordingly, whether one obtains a hold on Soma, or whether

one does not, they both obtain (glory),--for it is glory that people thereby get to see. Glorious therefore he becomes, and sovereignty he obtains, whosoever, knowing this, establishes a sacrificial fire of his own.

2. Now once upon a time the gods deposited with Agni all forms (rūpa) [^egg_708], both domestic and wild; either because they were about to engage in battle, or from a desire of free scope, or because they thought that he (Agni) would protect them as the best protector.

[^egg_708]: 314:1 Compare the corresponding legend Taitt, S. I, 5, 1; according to which the gods deposited their precious goods (vāmaṁ vasu) with Agni; and Pūshan and Tvashṭr̥, on performing sacrifice to Agni exclusively (the punarādhyeya), became possessed of the cattle, whence the latter are said to belong to Pūshan (paushṇa) and to Tvashṭr̥ (tvāshṭra). Afterwards Manu and Dhātr̥ (here identified with the year) also performed the ceremony. See also Śat. Br. II, 3, 4, 1 seq.

7. Let him establish the fires (the second time) in the rainy season. The rains are all the seasons, for the rains are indeed all the seasons: hence, in counting over years, people say, 'In such and such a year (or rain, varsha) we did it; in such and such a year (or rain) we did it.' The rains, then, are one of the forms of manifestation (rūpa) of all seasons [^egg_711]; and when people say, 'To-day it is as if in summer,' then that is in the rainy season; and when they say, 'To-day it is as if in spring,' then that, too, is in the rainy season. From the year (or rain, varsha), indeed, (is named) the rainy season (varshāḥ).

[^egg_711]: 315:2 This speculation is based on the identity of the words for year (varsha; also 'rain') and the rains, or rainy season (varshāḥ).

Or it may be an ox; for the latter is of the nature of Agni as far as its shoulder is concerned, since its shoulder (by carrying the yoke) is as if burnt by fire. Moreover, Agni is oblation-bearer to the gods, and that (ox) bears (or draws, loads) for men: this is why an ox may be given as the priests' fee.

[^egg_735]: 322:2 See also II, 2, 4, 15. In Taitt. S. I, 5, 12 (referred to Kāty. XI, 2, 37) 'white gold' (rajataṁ hiraṇyam), i.e. silver, is expressly mentioned as unsuitable for the dakshiṇā. The reason adduced is that, when the gods claimed back the goods deposited with Agni, he wept, and the tears he shed became silver; and hence, if one were to give silver as a dakshiṇā, there would be weeping in his house before a year had passed.
