1. Verily, by means of the Great Oblation the gods slew Vr̥tra; by it they gained that supreme authority which they now wield. Now whichever of them were hit by (the Asuras’) arrows in that battle, those same darts they extracted, those they pulled out, by performing the Tryambaka-offerings.

2. And, accordingly, when he performs those offerings, he either does so hoping that thus no arrow

 (misfortune) will hit any of his, or because the gods did so. And thereby he delivers from Rudra's power both the descendants that are born unto him and those that are unborn; and his offspring is brought forth without disease and blemish. This is why he performs these offerings.

From thence he rises and threshes (the rice), while standing with his face towards the north. He places the two mill-stones on (the black antelope skin, so as to incline) towards the north; and puts the potsherds on the north side of the Gārhapatya hearth.

[^egg_982]: 438:1 This refers to the so-called prāṇadāna, or 'bestowal of life  (or soul),' that is, the anointing of the sacrificial dishes with ghee, previously to their being placed on the altar. The anointing takes place with the text (Vāj. S. ed. p. 35), 'That life (or soul, prāṇa) of thine which has entered into the cattle, and becomes diffused through the various forms of the gods,--endowed with (that) life (ātmanvān)--for thou art laden with ghee--go to Agni, O Soma! and obtain bliss (svar) for the Sacrificer!' Katy. II, 8, 14. At the new and full-moon sacrifice, this ceremony is not even alluded to in our Brāhmaṇa, either in this or the Kāṇva recension. See I, 3, 4, 16. The Kāṇva text reads, 'They may be anointed,' so they say, &c.

unanointed; for, indeed, Rudra would be hankering after the (sacrificer's) cattle, if he were to anoint (the cakes): let them therefore be unanointed.

7. Having removed all (the cakes from the potsherds) into one dish, and taken a fire-brand from the Dakshiṇa-fire, he walks aside towards the north--for that is the region of that god--and offers. He offers on a road,--for on roads that god roves; he offers on a cross-road,--for the cross-road, indeed, is known to be his (Rudra's) favourite haunt [^egg_983]. This is why he offers on a cross-road.

[^egg_983]: 439:1 'He offers on a cross-road, for such is the halting-place (paḍbīśa) of the Agnis,' Taitt. Br. I, 6, 10, 3.

[^egg_984]: 439:2 'The central leaflet of the palāśa-leaf is the Brahman,' Kāṇva text. The leaf of the palāśa (Butea Frondosa) consists of three leaflets,--leathery, above shining and pretty smooth, and below slightly hoary; the central (or terminal) one being obovate and considerably larger than the lateral ones (which, according to Roxburgh, Flora Ind., III, p. 244, are from 4 to 6 inches long, and from 3 to 4½ broad). 'Palāśaśākhāyām yāni trīṇi parṇāni tatra madhyamam parṇam praśastayā srugrūpam,' Sāy. on Taitt. S. I, 8, 6.

9. He offers [^egg_985], with the text (Vāj. S. III, 57 a), This is thy share, O Rudra! graciously accept it together with thy sister Ambikā! Svāhā!' Ambikā [^egg_986], indeed, is the name of his (Rudra's) sister; and this share belongs to him conjointly with her; and because that share belongs to him conjointly with a woman (strī), therefore (these oblations) are called Tryambakāḥ. Thereby, then, he delivers from Rudra's power the descendants that have been born unto him.

[^egg_985]: 440:1 He consecrates, by the usual fivefold lustration, some spot on a cross-way, to the north of the sacrificial ground, and after laying down the fire-brand taken from the Dakshiṇāgni, he offers thereon, using the central leaflet of a palāśa-leaf as the offering-spoon.

[^egg_986]: 440:2 In Taitt. Br. I, 6, 10, 4, this sister of Rudra is identified with the autumn, wherewith the god is wont to kill (viz. by means of catarrh, fever, &c., Sāy.). See also Weber, Ind. Stud. I, 183; Muir, Original Sanskrit Texts, vol. iv. p. 321.

10. Now as to that additional (cake),--he buries it in a mole-hill [^egg_987], with the text (Vāj. S. III, 57 b), 'This is thy share, O Rudra! the mole is thy animal (victim).' He thus assigns to him the mole as the only animal [^egg_988], and he (Rudra) does not therefore injure any other animal. Then as to why he buries (the cake): concealed, indeed, are embryos, and concealed also is what is buried,--that is why he buries it. By this (offering) he delivers from the power of Rudra those descendants of his, that are not yet born.

[^egg_987]: 440:3 'Ākhūtkara;' 'ākhukarīsha,' Kāṇva text. Possibly a mouse-hole, or the earth thrown up by a mouse, is meant. See p. 278, note 3. Cf. Taitt. Br. I, 6,10, 2: 'N.N. is thy victim,' thus saying, let him indicate the one he (the Sacrificer) hates; thereby he delivers over to him (Rudra) the one he hates. If he hate no one, let him say, 'the mole (mouse) is thy victim.'

Thereby they make them medicine, and hence, if they fail to catch them, they touch them.

Sāyaṇa takes go to mean 'earth,' and interprets, 'in such a way that the earth does not obtain it (i.e. that they do not fall to the ground).' Kāty. prescribes, V, 10, 18, The Sacrificer, with his joined open hands, throws the Rudra-cakes upwards as high as not to be reachable by a cow (agoḥprāpaṇam); 19, He catches them; 20, If they cannot be (caught), then touching (of those that have fallen on the ground).

[^egg_991]: 443:1 In the Vāj. Saṁhitā this forms part of the text, but it is clearly a gloss taken from the Brāhmaṇa.
