1. Verily, Prajāpati alone was here in the beginning. He desired, 'May I exist, may I reproduce myself!' He toiled, he practised austerity (or, became heated). From him, worn out and heated, the waters were created: from that heated Person the waters are born.

2. The waters said, 'What is to become of us?'--'Ye shall be heated,' he said. They were heated; they created foam: hence foam is produced in heated water.

3. The foam (m.) said, 'What is to become of me?'--'Thou shalt be heated!' he said. It was heated, and produced clay; for indeed the foam is heated, when it floats on the water, covering it; and when one beats upon it, it indeed becomes clay.

4. The clay (f.) said, 'What is to become of me?'--'Thou shalt be heated!' he said. It was heated,

and produced sand; for this clay becomes indeed heated when they plough it; and if only they plough very fine then it becomes, as it were, sandy. So much, then, as to that 'What is to become of me? what is to become of me [^egg_320]?'

[^egg_320]: 158:1 He means to say that he will leave this to be supplied in the enumeration of the subsequent creations.

5. From the sated he created the pebble: whence sand finally indeed becomes a pebble;--from the pebble the stone: whence the pebble finally indeed becomes a stone;--from the stone metal ore: whence from stone they smelt ore;--from ore gold: whence ore much smelted comes, as it were, to have the appearance of gold.

7. 'This has indeed become (bhū) a foundation (resting-place),' so he thought: whence it became the earth (bhūmi). He spread it out (prath): it became the broad (earth, pr̥thivī). On this earth, as on a foundation, the beings, and the lord of beings, consecrated themselves for a year: the lord of beings was the master of the house [^egg_321], and Ushas (the Dawn) was the mistress.

9. Prajāpati said to him, 'My boy, why criest thou, when thou art born out of labour and trouble?' He said, 'Nay, but I am not freed from (guarded against) evil; I have no name given me: give me a name!' Hence one should give a name to the boy that is born, for thereby one frees him from evil;--even a second, even a third (name), for thereby one frees him from evil time after time.

'For two (years),' however, say some; 'for in one year they laid the seed, and in one year that boy was born, therefore let him build for two (years), and recite for two (years).' Let him, however, build for a year only, and recite for a year; for the same seed which is laid is brought forth; it then lies changing and growing: hence let him build for a year only, and recite for a year. To him (Agni) when built up (cita) he gives a name: whereby he keeps away evil from him. He calls him by a bright (citra) name [^egg_327], saying, 'Thou art bright;' for Agni is all bright things.

[^egg_327]: 161:2 Or, he calls him by the name of Citra (bright), that being the name by which he is actually to address the fire on the altar at the end of the performance. Kāty. XVIII, 6, 23.
