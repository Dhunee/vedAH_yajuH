1. Verily, in the beginning there was here the non-existent [^egg_282]. As to this they say, 'What was that non-existent?' The R̥shis, assuredly,--it is they that were the non-existent [^egg_283]. As to this they say, 'Who were those R̥shis?' The R̥shis, doubtless, were the vital airs: inasmuch as before (the existence of) this universe, they, desiring it, wore themselves out (rish) with toil and austerity, therefore (they are called) R̥shis.

[^egg_282]: 143:1 Or, perhaps, In the beginning this (universe) was indeed nonexistent. Thus J. Muir, Or. S. T. IV, p. 22, of which translation of this cosmogonic myth considerable use has been made here. It need scarcely be remarked that 'idam' is constantly used in an adverbial sense in the Brāhmaṇa.

[^egg_283]: 143:2 In the original, 'the non-existent' is the subject of the clause, not the predicate as would appear from the translation. A similar transposition seems often advisable in English, for the sake of emphasis, and on other grounds. Muir's rendering, 'The Rishis say that in the beginning there was non-existence,' is a mistake.

2. This same vital air in the midst doubtless is Indra. He, by his power (indriya), kindled those (other) vital airs from the midst; and inasmuch as he kindled (indh), he is the kindler (indha): the kindler [^egg_284] indeed,--him they call 'Indra' mystically

[^egg_284]: 143:3 The nominative here is striking, and vivid, cf. paragraph 11 below. In corresponding passages of the preceding books, the accusative would stand here; ej. II, 1, 2, 4, saptarshīn u ha sma vai purarkshā ity ācakshate; similarly III, 1, 2, 3.

 (esoterically), for the gods love the mystic. They (the vital airs), being kindled, created seven separate persons [^egg_285] (purusha).

[^egg_285]: 144:1 That is, living beings or souls, individualities, which, in their combined form, are here imagined to take the shape of a bird. Muir's rendering, 'males,' can scarcely commend itself.

They made those seven persons one Person: they compressed two of them [^egg_286] (into) what is above the navel, and two of them (into) what is below the navel; (one) person was (one) wing (or side), (one) person was (the other) wing, and one person was the base (i.e. the feet).

And because they resorted to the whole (system) therefore (this is called) body (śarīra).

6. He verily is composed of seven persons, for this Person (Agni) is composed of seven persons [^egg_287],

[^egg_287]: 144:3 The fire-altar is usually constructed so as to measure seven  man's lengths square; the particular length being that of the Sacrificer. This, however, is the smallest size allowed for an altar, there being altogether ninety-five different sizes specified, varying between seven and 101 man's lengths square.

8. Now this Person Prajāpati desired, 'May I be more (than one), may I be reproduced!' He toiled, he practised austerity. Being worn out with toil and austerity, he created first of all the Brahman (neut.), the triple science. It became to him a foundation: hence they say, 'the Brahman (Veda) is the foundation of everything here.' Wherefore, having studied (the Veda) one rests on a foundation; for this, to wit, the Veda, is his foundation. Resting on that foundation, he (again) practised austerity.

10. He desired, 'May I be reproduced from these waters!' He entered the waters with that triple science. Thence an egg arose. He touched it. 'Let it exist! let it exist and multiply!' so he said. From it the Brahman (neut.) was first created, the triple science. Hence they say, 'The Brahman (n.) is the first-born of this All.' For even before that Person the Brahman was created [^egg_289]: it was created as his mouth. Hence they say of him who has studied the Veda, that 'he is like Agni;' for it, the Brahman (Veda), is Agni's mouth.
