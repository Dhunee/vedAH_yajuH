1. 'Let him drive Agni about while keeping him up, so they say. The gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Prajāpati, were contending. The gods drove about on wheels (cars), and the Asuras stayed at home. The gods, while driving about on wheels, saw [^egg_543] this rite (sacrificial performance), for it was indeed in driving about on wheels that they saw this rite: hence it is to the cart that the formulas relate at the (performance with) sacrificial cakes [^egg_544], and to the cart in the building of the fire-altar [^egg_545].

[^egg_543]: 289:1 Sāyaṇa says, 'vīrasiddheḥ,' 'by the heroes’ success.'

[^egg_544]: 289:2 See I, 1, 2, 5.

[^egg_545]: 289:3 Sāyaṇa refers to Vāj. S. XII, 31, 'upwards may the All-gods bear thee . . .' (paragraph 9) below, as a passage in point.

2. Now he who drives Agni about goes to the gods by the sacred performance, for divine is the rite performed by him; but he who does not drive him about goes to the Asuras by the sacred performance, for demoniac is the rite performed by him.

3. Here now some say, 'It is by himself that he (Agni) is driven about; for by the Vishṇu-strides he drives forward, and by the Vātsapra he unyokes.' Let him not think this to be so; for divine (to the gods) is that progress of his, to wit, the Vishṇu-strides; and divine the unyoking, to wit, the Vātsapra. But human would be that progress of his, which he makes in this manner, and human the unyoking he makes.

4. This Agni is Prajāpati; and Prajāpati is both the gods and men. Now when the Vishṇu-strides and the Vātsapra are (performed), he thereby makes up that form of his which is divine; and when he drives him about he thereby makes up that form of his which is human. Verily, then, he who, knowing this, drives him about, makes up that whole and entire Prajāpati: let him therefore by all means drive him (Agni) about.

5. Now on any day on which he may intend to drive, he gets the chariot placed north of the fire (with the pole) to the east; and puts a kindling-stick on it (the fire); for at that time the gods first regaled him (Agni) with food, with that kindling-stick, when he was about to start: and in like manner does this one now first regale him with food, with that kindling-stick, when he is about to start.

7. He then lifts him (the fire) up, with (Vāj. S. XII, 31), 'Upwards may the All-gods bear thee, O Agni, by their thoughts!'--at the beginning all the gods did indeed bear him upwards by their thoughts, for that (or, he) was then their thought: in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now bear him upwards by his thoughts, for this now is his thought;--'be thou gracious unto us, of fair look, and rich splendour!'--as the text, so its meaning. From the south he places him (Agni) northwards

on (the chariot)--the significance of this has been explained. Having put the Gārhapatya into a pot, he places it on (the chariot) behind (the Āhavanīya, or Ukhya Agni). If he choose, he himself may mount up beside him (Agni), or he may walk by the side (of the chariot).

8. He then yokes two oxen, first the right one, then the left one: so (it is done) with the gods, otherwise in human (practice). And in whatever direction he may intend to drive, let him first drive east, for the east is Agni's region: he (Agni) thus proceeds towards his own region.

11. And, again, why he mutters that prayer;--with whomsoever, mounted (on a chariot), the axle creaks, this is his own voice: hence when the axle creaks while Agni is mounted, this is the voice of Agni himself.

With a (verse) containing (the verb) 'sthā' (he performs), for he thereby makes him stop (sthā) for (staying at) his home.

[^egg_547]: 292:1 Mahīdhara, in accordance with Nigh. III, 18 (priest), explains 'bharata' as the one who brings (blear) offerings; and, with Sāyaṇa, identifies the Bharata with the Sacrificer.
