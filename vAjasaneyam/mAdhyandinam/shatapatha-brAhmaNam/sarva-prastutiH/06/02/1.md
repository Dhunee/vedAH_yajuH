1. Prajāpati set his mind upon Agni's forms. He searched for that boy (Kumāra) who had entered

into the (different) forms. Agni became aware of it,--'Surely, Father Prajāpati is searching for me: well then, let me be suchlike that he knows me not.'

5. He considered, 'They are Agni: I will fit them unto mine own self [^egg_329]. Even as Agni, when kindled, glares, so their eye glares; even as Agni's smoke rises upwards, so vapour rises from them; even as Agni consumes what is put in him, so they devour; even as Agni's ashes fall down, so do their faeces: they are indeed Agni; I will fit them unto mine own self.' He meant to slaughter them for different deities: the Purusha (man) for Viśvakarman, the horse for Varuṇa, the bull for Indra, the ram for Tvashṭr̥, the he-goat for Agni.

[^egg_329]: 162:1 Or, I will make them part of mine own self.--Similarly St. Petersburg dictionary, 'I will change them into myself.' But differently Professor Delbrück, Altind. Synt., p. 239, 'I will make myself to be these, change myself into these.' This is on account of the middle form of the verb, which, however, is quite justified also in the former interpretation. Cf. VI, 8, 2, 1, where there is no question of changing the whole sacrifice into a heap of ashes, but of taking over the ashes, or some of it, to form part of the sacrifice.

He slaughtered them for the Agnis, as for (his) desire,--to wit, 'for the Agnis,' because many were the forms of Agni he had set his mind upon; and 'for the desire,' because it was with a desire that he slaughtered them. Having appeased them and carried the fire round them, he led them northwards and slew them.

He cut off the heads and put them on (himself, or the altar). The remaining trunks he then let float on the water  [^egg_332], and brought the sacrifice to its completion by means of (the offering of) a he-goat, thinking, 'Lest my sacrifice be pulled to pieces.' After performing that animal sacrifice, Prajāpati saw that he had not yet reached the end of Agni (the fire-altar).

[^egg_330]: 163:1 See VI, 1, 1, 4.

[^egg_331]: 163:2 That is, on the fire-altar, or (which is the same thing) on himself, Prajāpati, the sacrifice. The heads of the five victims are placed in (a dish introduced into) the bottom layer of the altar so as to impart stability to it. See VII, 5, 2, 1 seq.

9. He considered, 'Surely, if I fit [^egg_335] this (matter) such as it is unto mine own self, I shall become a mortal carcase, not freed from evil: well then, I will bake it by means of the fire.' So saying, he baked it by means of the fire, and thereby made it immortal; for the sacrificial food which is baked by fire is indeed immortal (or, ambrosia). Hence they bake the bricks with fire: they thereby make them immortal.

10. And inasmuch as he saw them after offering (ishṭvā) the animal, therefore they are bricks (ishṭakā).

And, moreover, there is this other (consideration).

12. And because Agni is all those animal victims, therefore animals delight (being) near the fire [^egg_337],--

[^egg_337]: 164:3 Sāyaṇa seems to take this to mean, that animals (cattle) delight, or sport, when the sacrificial fire is established; that is to say, they feel at home and increase wherever a new household is established (?);--tasmād agnāv āhite paśavo ramante, ātmany eva sā prītir ity abhiprāyaḥ.

24. He recites both gāyatrī and trishṭubh verses; for the gāyatrī metre is the vital air, and the trishṭubh is the body (self): by the gāyatrī verses he thus kindles his vital air, and by the trishṭubh ones the body. The trishṭubh verses are in the middle, and the gāyatrī verses on both sides thereof; for this body is in the middle, and the (organs of) the vital airs are on the sides thereof. He pronounces more gāyatrī verses before, and fewer after (the

trishṭubh verses); for there are more (organs of the) vital airs in front, and fewer behind.

25. He recites (Vāj. S. XXVII, 1), 'May the months [^egg_341], O Agni, may the seasons make thee grow!' When Agni restored the relaxed Prajāpati, he (Prajāpati) said to him, 'What kindling-verses there are equal to me (in measure), with them kindle me!'

[^egg_341]: 168:1 This is the meaning assigned here to 'samāḥ' by Mahīdhara, a doubtful meaning indeed. Besides the ordinary meaning year,' the St. Petersburg dictionary also allows to 'samā' that of 'half-year' in some passages of the Atharva-veda. In the present passage, the dictionary refers 'samāḥ' to the adjective 'sama,' hence 'the equal seasons.' This cannot, however, have been the meaning assigned to the word by the author of this part of the Brāhmaṇa, whatever it may originally have been in this verse of the Saṁhitās. Sāyaṇa, Taitt. S. IV, 1, 7, takes 'samāḥ' in the sense of 'the years,' but remarks that 'the months and half-months' have to be understood by it in this verse.
