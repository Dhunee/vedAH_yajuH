1. He then holds it (the fire in the pan) up thus (towards north-east). Now the gods at that time were desiring, 'May we be like Parjanya (the rain-god)!' By that body (of his [^egg_528]) they became like Parjanya, and in like manner does the Sacrificer by that body (of his) become like Parjanya.

[^egg_528]: 277:1 Viz. by the Agni who is now being held up, and of whom Parjanya is said to be another form, at VI, 1, 3, 15. It is probably the smoke rising from the fire-pan that suggests the idea of the Jupiter pluvius sending forth his flashes of light from the dark cloud.

2. [Vāj. S. XII, 6; R̥k S. X, 45, 4] 'Agni roared like the thundering sky,'--for he (Agni) indeed roars like the thundering Parjanya;--'again and again licking the ground, stroking [^egg_529] the plants,'--for Parjanya, whilst licking again and

He holds it (the fire in the pan) up so as to be beyond the reach of his arms, for Parjanya is beyond the reach of (our) arms.

He then lowers it; for whatever sap, whatever sustenance there is in this world, that rises upwards with it through these worlds, for Agni is the sap, Agni is the substance in this world: thus were that always to be so [^egg_530], then there would be no sap, no sustenance in this world; but when he lowers (the fire), he bestows sap and sustenance on this world.

these worlds both from here upwards and from thence backwards.

6. [Vāj. S.

Four times he lowers (the fire further and further), for four times it rises upwards: thus as often as it rises upwards, so often he lowers it; and having lowered it (completely), he holds it above his navel: the significance of this has been explained [^egg_531].
