2. Now that truth is the same as yonder sun. It is a gold (plate), for gold is light, and he (the sun) is the light; gold is immortality, and he is immortality. It (the plate) is round, for he (the sun) is round. It has twenty-one knobs, for he is the twenty-first [^egg_504]. He wears it with the knobs outside, for the knobs are his (the sun's) rays, and his rays arc outside.

26. And, again, why he takes hold of him by means of two pads,--he, Agni, is yonder sun, and the two pads are these two worlds: he thus encompasses yonder sun by these two worlds, and hence he is encompassed by these two worlds. They are round, for these two worlds are round; of reed-grass, triply wound,--the significance of this has been told;--and smeared with clay,--(the significance) of this also has been told, but it also serves to keep them from taking fire.

27. Now then the (mystic) correspondence (of the number of objects to the nature of Agni),--the seat, the fire-pan, the sling of the gold plate, the fire, and the gold plate,--these amount to six;--six seasons are a year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become. Two pads, that makes eight,--the Gāyatrī has eight syllables, and Agni is Gāyatra as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become.

28. Now the total correspondence,--four feet and four boards (of the seat), the netting, and the sling of the gold plate, or any other corded netting; after that the pan and fire, and the gold plate,--that makes thirteen;--thirteen months are a year, and the year is Agni: as great as Agni is, as great as is his measure, so great does this become.
