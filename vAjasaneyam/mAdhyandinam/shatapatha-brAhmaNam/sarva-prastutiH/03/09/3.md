1. They (the priests) are wakened (towards morning). Having touched water [^egg_565], they proceed together to the Āgnīdhra (fire-house) and take the portions of ghee (for the Savanīya animal offerings). Having taken the portions of ghee, they betake themselves (to the high altar). When they have deposited the ghee,--

2. He (the Adhvaryu) takes down the king (Soma) [^egg_566]. Now this (earth) is a safe resting-place, and the birth-place of living beings; it is to this safe resting-place that he now takes him down; he spreads him thereon, produces him therefrom.

[^egg_566]: 227:1 According to Kāty. VIII, 9, 24-25, on the previous evening,--immediately after the carrying round And depositing of the Vasatīvarī water,--the Soma is placed on a seat (āsandi) in the Āgnīdhra fire house, where the sacrificer has to watch over it during that night. This is not mentioned in the Brāhmaṇa, and from what follows it would rather seem that the Soma is taken down from the cart (see III, 6, 3, 17 seq.). Otherwise we might translate, 'He brings him down (from the Āgnīdhra).'

3. He takes him down between the shafts; for the cart is (a means of) the sacrifice, and thus alone he does not put him outside the sacrifice. He puts him on the pressing stones lying there with their heads (mukha, mouths) [^egg_567] towards each other; for Soma is the nobility, and the stones are the clans (people); he thereby raises the nobility over the clan. And as to why they are lying with their heads together,--he thereby makes the clan of one head (or mouth) with, and uncontentious towards, the nobles; therefore they are lying with their heads towards each other.

7. Having quitted his hold (of Soma) he sits down by him, with, 'May all thy people descend to thee.' Now, in saying, 'Descend unto all thy people,' he does what is unseemly, for Soma being the nobility, he thereby, as it were, confounds good and bad [^egg_568],--and, indeed, in consequence thereof, people now confound good and bad. But in this (formula) he does what is right and according to order,--in saying, 'May all thy people descend to thee,' he makes all his subjects go down (on their knees) before him; and hence when a noble approaches, all these subjects, the people, go down before him, crouch down by him on the ground [^egg_569]. Sitting near (Soma), the Hotr̥ is about to recite the morning-prayer.

[^egg_568]: 228:1 'He commits a pāpavasyasaṁ, i.e. according to Haug, Ait. Br. p. 413, 'a breach of the oath of allegiance,' (where Sāyaṇa explains it by 'exceedingly bad'); or 'an (act of) perversity,' Weber, Ind. Stud. IX, p. 300. Sāyaṇa, to our passage, explains it by 'mixing the bad with the good (or better).' The literal translation is 'a bad-bettering.' What is chiefly implied in the term is evidently the showing of disrespect by an inferior to a superior person.

10. And when he puts on a kindling-stick, it is the metres he thereby kindles. And when the Hotr̥ recites the morning-prayer [^egg_571], he thereby

[^egg_571]: 229:2 The Prātar-anuvāka, or morning-prayer (matin chant), has to be recited by the Hotr̥ in the latter part of the night before any sound (of birds, &c.) is to be heard. It may begin immediately after midnight, and conclude as soon as daylight appears. When called upon by the Adhvaryu to recite the morning-prayer, the Hotr̥ first makes an oblation of ghee on the Āgnīdhra fire, with the mantra, 'Protect me from the spell of the mouth, from every imprecation, Hail!' and then two oblations on the Āhavanīya with appropriate mantras. Thereupon he betakes himself to the Havirdhāna (cart-shed), in entering which, by the east door, he touches successively the front-wreath (rarāṭā, cf. III, 5, 3, 9) and the doorposts, with formulas. He then squats down between the yoke-pieces of the two Soma-carts, and begins his recitation with Rig-veda X, 30, 12, 'Ye, O wealthy waters, verily possess good things; ye confer desirable energy and immortality; ye command riches with abundant offspring: may Sarasvatī (the river S., and Speech) bestow on the bard that vital vigour!' The 'early-coming' deities to whom the recitation is successively addressed, are Agni, Ushas (the dawn), and the two Aśvins (the precursors of the sun); the prayer thus consisting of three sections, termed kratu (Agnikratu , &c.). The hymns and detached verses making up these sections are arranged according to the seven metres (thus forming seven sub-sections of each), viz. gāyatrī, anushṭubh, trishṭubh, br̥hatī, ushṇih, jagatī, and paṅkti. The prayer may consist of as many verses as can be recited between midnight and daybreak; but there should be at least one hymn in each of the seven metres to each of the three deities; nor should the recitation consist of less than a hundred verses. From the beginning of the recitation up to the end of the last hymn but one, Rig-veda I, 112, there is to be a gradual modulation of the voice so as to pass upwards through the seven tones (yama) of the deep scale (mandrasvara). Moreover, that hymn is to be repeated (if necessary) till daylight appears. As soon as this is the case, he passes on without any break from the last (25th) verse to the last hymn (v. 75, 1-9), which he intones in the lowest tone of the middle scale, after shifting his place further east towards the gate. The recitation of the first eight verses of this hymn again gradually ascends through the whole of the middle scale; when--after once more shifting his place so as to be seated between the two door-posts--he intones the last verse--'The Dawn hath appeared with her shining kine, Agni hath been kindled at his appointed time: your car hath been yoked, ye mighty, mead-loving(?) Aśvins, showerers of wealth, hear my call!' in reciting which he makes his voice pass through the several tones of the high scale. The Subrahmaṇyā, likewise, has to chant the Subrahmaṇyā litany (see III, 3, 4, 17 seq.)--as he had to do on the previous evening--inserting in it the names of the sacrificer's father and son. The Agnīdh, in the meantime, prepares the five havis-oblations (savanīyāḥ puroḍaśāḥ) to be offered at the morning-pressing (cf. IV, 2, 4, 18), and the Unnetr̥ puts the numerous Soma-vessels in their respective places on the khara, and about the Soma-carts.

again strengthens the metres, makes them to be of unimpaired vigour; for the metres had their vigour impaired by the gods, since it was through the metres that the gods reached the heavenly worlds; they neither sing praises (chants) nor recite (śastras) here. Hereby he now again strengthens the metres and makes them to be of unimpaired vigour; and by means of them, thus unimpaired in vigour, they

perform the sacrifice; this is why the Hotr̥ recites the morning-prayer.

The first verse is recited thrice, and the tenth verse is recited after the eleventh, while the priests are returning with the water. As soon as they are in sight, the Hotr̥ recites verse 13, followed by Rig-veda V, 43, 1; and (when the Ekadhanā and Vasatīvarī waters meet together, paragraph 29) Rig-veda II, 35, 3; and, in case some of the water is actually poured over into the Hotr̥'s cup, I, 83, 2. When the water is brought to the Havirdhāna, the Hotr̥ addresses the Adhvaryu as stated in paragraph 31; whereupon he pronounces a 'nigada' (for which see Ait. Br. II, 20; Āśv. Sr. V, 1, 14-17), followed by Rig-veda I, 23, i6; while the Ekadhana pitchers are carried past him. The water in the Maitrāvaruṇa cup and one third of both the Vasatīvarī and Ekadhanā water having been poured into the Ādhavanīya trough (standing on the northern cart), the pitchers with the remaining water are then deposited in their respective places behind the axle of the northern cart, whereupon the Hotr̥ recites the two remaining verses (24 and 15) of the  Aponaptrīya hymn, and sits down in front of the Soma, behind the northern door-post of the Havirdhāna (cart-shed).

as a coal is consumed by Fire, so is that oblation consumed by that deity.

He then takes (water) with, 'I draw thee up for the imperishableness of the ocean;' for the ocean is water; he thus confers imperishableness upon the waters; wherefore, in spite of so much food (and drink) being consumed, the waters are not diminished. Thereupon they draw (water in) the Ekadhana pitchers, and thereupon the vessels for washing the feet [^egg_577].

[^egg_577]: 235:1 These are filled by the sacrificer's wife, or, if there be more than one sacrificer (or, if the sacrificer have more than one wife), by all the wives, each having two vessels. For the use of this water, see note on IV, 4, 2, 18.

28. The reason why he takes (water) with the Maitrāvaruṇa's cup is this. When the sacrifice escaped from the gods, the gods endeavoured to call it up by means of (sacrificial) calls (praisha) [^egg_578]; by means of the puroruc ('shining before') formulas [^egg_579] they pleased it (pra-rocaya), and by the nivids they made (their wishes) known (ni-vid) to it. Therefore he takes (water) with the Maitrāvaruṇa's cup.

[^egg_578]: 235:2 The praishas or sacrificial directions to the Hotr̥, for the recitations of offering-formulas, are given by the Maitrāvaruṇa; see p. 183, note 2.

30. Now some indeed pour (some of) the Vasatīvarī water into the Maitrāvaruṇa's cup, and from the Maitrāvaruṇa's cup (back) to the Vasatīvarī water, arguing, 'Thereby we mix together both the sap of the sacrifice which was fetched yesterday and that fetched to-day.' But let him not do this; for when he pours (the water) together into the Ādhavanīya trough [^egg_580], then both kinds of sap are mixed together. Thereupon he pours the Vasatīvarī water into the Hotr̥'s cup for the Nigrābhyās [^egg_581]. And as to why he makes them touch one another close over the pit, it was from thence, forsooth, that the gods rose to heaven; he thus makes the sacrificer look along the road to heaven.

[^egg_580]: 236:1 See p. 232, note 2 to paragraph 15.

[^egg_581]: 236:2 Nigrābhyāḥ is the technical name the Vasatīvarī water in the Hotr̥'s cup henceforth bears. It is handed to the sacrificer to carry to the Havirdhāna; and is afterwards used for moistening the Soma plants (or, for being poured thereon) at the time of the pressing. See III, 9, 4, 14 seq.

spoon sufficient for an oblation, let him offer that. But if it be not sufficient for an oblation, he takes another portion of ghee in four ladlings and offers it, with (Vāj. S. VI, 29; Rig-veda I, 27, 7), 'Whatever mortal thou favourest in battles, whomsoever thou speedest in the race, he winneth unfailing strength, Hail!' He offers with (a prayer) to Agni, because the Agnishṭoma ('Agni's praise') means Agni; thus he establishes the Agnishṭoma in Agni. [He offers] with (a verse) containing the word 'mortal,' because the Agnishṭoma is of the same measure as man. Let hire then offer in this manner, if it be an Agnishṭoma.
