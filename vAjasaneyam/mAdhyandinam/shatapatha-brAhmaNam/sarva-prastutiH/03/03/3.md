He says, 'Soma-seller, is thy king Soma for sale?'--'He is for sale,' says the Soma-seller.--'I will buy him of thee!'--'Buy him!' says the Soma-seller.--'I will buy him of thee for one-sixteenth (of the cow).'--'King Soma, surely, is worth more than that!' says the Soma-seller.--'Yea, King Soma is worth more than that; but great, surely, is the greatness of the cow,' says the Adhvaryu.

4. He (the Adhvaryu) says, 'Gold is thine, a cloth is thine, a goat is thine, a milch cow is thine, a pair of kine is thine, three other (cows) are thine!' And because they first bargain and afterwards come to terms, therefore about any and everything that is for sale here, people first bargain and afterwards

come to terms. And the reason why only the Adhvaryu enumerates the virtues of the cow, and not the Soma-seller those of the Soma, is that Soma is already glorified, since Soma is a god. And the Adhvaryu thereby glorifies the cow, thinking, 'Seeing her virtues he shall buy her!' This is why only the Adhvaryu enumerates the virtues of the cow, and not the Soma-seller those of the Soma.

7. He then tempts [^egg_187] the Soma-seller (with the gold): 'In compensation [^egg_188] for thy cow,' whereby he means to say, 'With the sacrificer (be) thy cow!'

[^egg_187]: 70:2 Or, according to the commentaries, 'he frightens the Soma-seller (by threatening to take back the money).'

[^egg_188]: 70:3 ? Sagme (? compact), explained by the commentators as meaning the sacrificer. Perhaps it may mean, 'one of the parties to an agreement,' and hence here the sacrificer as the bargainee. The Kāṇva text reads, He then takes it back again (punar ādatte) with 'Sagme to goḥ,' and throws it down with 'Ours thy gold.'

 He then draws it (the gold) back towards the sacrificer, and throws it down, with, 'Ours be thy gold!' whereby he (the sacrificer) takes unto himself the vital energy, and the Soma-seller gets only the body. Thereupon the Soma-seller takes it [^egg_189].

[^egg_189]: 71:1 According to some authorities, the gold is again taken away forcibly from the Soma-seller by the Adhvaryu, after the sacrificer has uncovered his head (paragraph a 2), and the seller is driven away by blows with a speckled cane. Kāty. VII, 8, 27. According to Āpastamba (ib.), he buys off the Soma-cow with another cow, and then dismisses her to the cow-pen; and if the Soma-seller objects, he is to be beaten with a speckled cane. The Mānava-sūtra merely says, that they are to give the Soma-seller something for compensation. The whole transaction was evidently a feigned purchase, symbolising the acquisition of the Soma by the gods from the Gandharvas. The real bargain was probably concluded before the sacrificial performance. See also Haug, Ait. Br. Transl. p. 59, note 2.

8. He then makes him (the sacrificer) say on the she-goat, which stands facing the west, 'Thou art the bodily form of fervour,'--that she-goat was indeed produced as the bodily form of fervour, of Prajāpati; hence he says, 'Thou art the bodily form of fervour,'--'Prajāpati's kind,' because she brings forth three times in the year, therefore she is Prajāpati's kind. 'Thou art bought with the most excellent animal,' because she brings forth three times in the year, she is the most excellent of animals. 'May I increase with a thousandfold increase!' Thereby he implores a blessing: a thousand meaning abundance, he thereby means to say, 'May I obtain abundance!'

Now it is he (Soma [^egg_195]) that becomes an embryo, and therefore he is enveloped, since embryos are, as it were, enveloped both in the amnion and the outer membrane.

The Kāṇva recension reads, 'Sa etam yajñam ajījanat sa esha garbho bhavaty ā sutyāyāḥ;' where 'ajījanat' seems to mean 'he has begotten.'
