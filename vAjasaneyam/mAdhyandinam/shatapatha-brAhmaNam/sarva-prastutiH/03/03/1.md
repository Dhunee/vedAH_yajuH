is why he steps into seven of her foot-prints. For when the metres were produced from Vāc (speech), the one consisting of seven feet, the Śakvarī, was the last (highest) of them. It is that (metre) he now draws down towards himself from above: this is why he steps into seven of her foot-prints.

2. It is as Vāc [^egg_158] that he steps into them; (with the text, Vāj. S. IV, 21), 'Thou art a Vasvī, thou art Aditi, thou art an Ādityā, thou art a Rudrā, thou art Candrā; for she is indeed a Vasvī and Aditi, an Ādityā, a Rudrā, Candrā. 'May Br̥haspati make thee rest in happiness!'--Br̥haspati being the Brahman, he thereby means to say, 'May Br̥haspati lead thee hither by means of the good (work) [^egg_159]!' 'Rudra, together with the Vasus, is well-pleased with thee:' this he says to secure her (the cow's) safety, for cattle cannot pass beyond Rudra.

[^egg_158]: 59:1 Literally, 'by a form (rūpeṇa) of Vāc (speech),' viz. the text which is pronounced.

[^egg_159]: 59:2 This can scarcely be the correct reading. The Kāṇva text has the more acceptable reading, 'Br̥haspati being the Brahman, and felicity the sacrifice, he thereby says, "May the Brahman make thee rest (or delight, ramayatu) in the good (work), the sacrifice!"'

4. He (the Adhvaryu) offers (with the text, Vāj. S.

Now, Soma is a male, and the wife is a female, and that Soma-cow becomes here (exchanged for) Soma: a productive union is thus effected;--this is why he causes her to be looked at by the Soma-cow.

[^egg_164]: 61:2 See St. Petersb. Dict. s. v. totas. The Kāṇva text explains it similarly: 'tvayi tvayi paśavaḥ.' The Taitt. S. VI, 1, 8, 5 has 'Tote rāyaḥ'--"Thine (?) is wealth" thus for the wife, for she, the wife, is one half of himself.'

13. One that is brown, with red-brown eyes, is (fit to be) a Soma-cow. For when Indra and Vishṇu divided a thousand (cows) into three parts, there was one left [^egg_166], and her they caused to propagate herself in three kinds; and hence, even now, if any one were to divide a thousand by three, one would remain over.

[^egg_166]: 62:2 This arithmetical feat of Indra and Vishṇu is apparently already referred to in Rig-veda VI, 69, 8, though nothing is said there as to the difficulty regarding the odd cow. The threefold division seems to refer to Vishṇu's three steps, by which (as the sun) he measures the sky; or to the division of the universe into the three worlds (?). See also Ait. Br. VI, 15.
