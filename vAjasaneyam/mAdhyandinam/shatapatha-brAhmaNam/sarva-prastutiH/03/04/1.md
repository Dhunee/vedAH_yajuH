1. Verily, the guest-offering is the head of the sacrifice, and the Prāyaṇīya and Udayanīya are its arms. But the arms are on both sides of the head: therefore those two oblations, the Prāyaṇīya and Udayanīya, are on both sides of the guest-offering.

2. Now as to why it is called 'guest-offering.' He, the purchased Soma, truly comes as his (the sacrificer's) guest,--to him (is offered) that (hospitable reception): even as for a king or a Brāhman one would cook a large ox or a large he-goat--for that is human (fare offered to a guest), and the oblation is that of the gods--so he prepares for him that guest-offering.

3. Here now they say, 'Let him first walk past (Soma) and take out (the material for offering)!' For (they argue) where people do not show respect

4. Then only one (of the oxen) is to be unyoked, and the other to be left unyoked [^egg_225]; and thereupon he is to take out (the material for offering): for (they argue) in that one of them is unyoked, thereby he (Soma) has arrived; and in that the other is left unyoked, thereby he is honoured.

[^egg_225]: 86:1 This is the practice recognised by the Taittirīyas (T. S. VI, 2, 1, 1), on the ground that, if one were to unyoke both oxen, he would interrupt the sacrifice; and if he were to leave them both unyoked, it would be as if a hospitable reception were given to one who has not actually arrived.

5. Let him, however, not do this but let him take out (the material for offering) only after unyoking (both oxen) and after making (Soma) enter (the hall); for the ways of men are in accordance with those of the gods. And accordingly, in human practice, so long as (a guest) has not unyoked, people do not bring water to him and show him no honour, for so long he has not yet arrived; but when he has unyoked, then they bring him water and show him honour, for then he has indeed arrived: let him therefore take out (the material for offering) only after unyoking and after making (Soma) enter (the hall).

7. Let him take out (the material) with a different formula from that wherewith (one takes out) any other oblations [^egg_227], since, when he (Soma) is bought, he is bought for one special destination,--for the sovereignty of the metres, for the supreme sovereignty of the metres. The metres act as attendants about him; even as the non-royal king-makers, the heralds and headmen, (attend upon) the king, so do the metres act as attendants about him (Soma).

[^egg_227]: 87:1 For the ordinary formula with which material for offering is taken out at an ishṭi, 'At the impulse of the divine Savitr̥, I take thee with the arms of the Aśvins, with the hands of Pūshan, thee well-pleasing to--!' see I, 1, 2, 17.

8. In no wise, then, is it befitting that he should take out any (material for offering) solely 'for the metres [^egg_228];' for whenever people cook food for some worthy person [^egg_229], then the attendants about him, the non-royal king-makers, the heralds and headmen, have their share (of the food) assigned to them; after (or along with their master): hence, when he takes out that (oblation to Soma), let him assign the metres a share in it along with (the deity).

[^egg_228]: 87:2 According to Taitt. S. VI, 2, 1, the five portions are taken out for the metres Gāyatrī, Trishṭubh, Jagatī, Anushṭubh, and Gāyatrī, with the texts, 'Thou art Agni's hospitable feast, for Vishṇu (I take) thee,' &c.

17. The prastara-bunch [^egg_235] is of aśvavāla-grass (Saccharum Spontaneum). For, once upon a time, the sacrifice escaped from the gods. It became a horse (aśva) and sped away from them. The gods, rushing after it, took hold of its tail (vāla) and tore it out; and having torn it out, they threw it down in a lump, and what had been the hairs of the horse's tail then grew up as those plants (of aśvavāla-grass). Now the guest-offering is the head of the sacrifice, and the tail is the hind-part (of animals): hence by the prastara being of aśvavāla-grass he encompasses the sacrifice on both sides.

[^egg_235]: 89:3 For the prastara, or bunch of reed-grass, representing the sacrificer, see I, 3, 3, 5 seq.; 8, 3. 11 seq. The aśvavāla (horsetail) grass (generally called kāśa) is said to resemble horse-hair, and is used for twine, mats, thatch, &c. Sir H. M. Elliot, 'Races of the N. W. Prov.' II, pp. 371, 372, describes it as growing from three to fifteen feet high, and flowering in great profusion after the rains; the base of the flowers being surrounded with a bright silvery fleece, which whitens the neighbouring fields so much as frequently to resemble a fall of snow.

23. He churns, with the texts, 'With the Gāyatrī metre I churn thee!--With the Trishṭubh metre I churn thee!--With the Gagatī metre I churn thee!' For it is with the metres that he churns him (Agni, the fire); the metres he recites to him when he is churned, whereby he attaches the metres to the sacrifice, even as the rays (are attached) to yonder sun.--'Recite to the born one!' he says,

when he (Agni) is produced [^egg_245]; and 'To him who is thrown [^egg_246]!' when he throws him (on the old Āhavanīya fire).

[^egg_245]: 92:1 The Hotr̥ recites the two verses, Rig-veda I, 74, 3; VI, 16, 40.

[^egg_246]: 92:2 The verb is 'pra-hr̥,' which is also the common term for the hurling of the thunderbolt. The six verses, recited by the Hotr̥; are Rig-veda VI, 16, 41-42; I, 12, 6; VIII, 43, 14; VIII, 73, 8; I, 164, 50.

24. He throws (the fire on the hearth), with the text (Vāj. S. V, 3), 'For our sake be ye two (fires) friendly to one another, of one mind, unblemished! Injure not the sacrifice, nor the lord of the sacrifice! be gracious unto us this day, ye knowers of beings!' He thus bespeaks peacefulness between them, that they may not injure each other.

25. He then takes out some clarified butter with the dipping-spoon, and pours it on the fire, with the text (Vāg. S. V, 4), 'Agni resorteth to Agni, he the son of the seers that shieldeth us from curses: graciously offer thou for us now with good offering, never withholding the oblation from the gods, Hail!' For the purpose of offering they have produced him, and by this offering he has now gratified him: that is why he thus makes offering unto him.

26. It (the guest-offering) ends with the Iḍā; no after-offerings are performed. For the guest-offering is the head of the sacrifice, and the head is the fore-part: he thus fits him up as the head of the sacrifice. But were he to perform the after-offerings, it would be as if, by reversing, he were to put the feet in the place of the head. Hence it ends with the Iḍā, and no after-offerings are performed.
