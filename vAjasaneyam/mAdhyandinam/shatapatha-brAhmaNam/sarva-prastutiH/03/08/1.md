2. They then proceed with the Āprī (verses). The reason why they proceed with the Āprīs is this. With his whole mind, with his whole self, forsooth, he who consecrates himself prepares and endeavours to prepare the sacrifice. His self is, as it were, emptied out; with those Āprīs they fill it again; and because they fill [^egg_465] it therewith, therefore they are called Āprī. For this reason they proceed with the Āprīs.

[^egg_465]: 185:1 The text has only 'āpyāyayanti,' but the verb with which the author connects the verb 'āprī' is either ā-pr̥ṇāti, he fills; or (more correctly) 'ā-prīṇāti,' he gratifies, propitiates, corresponding to the Zand āfrīnaiti. Perhaps some words have been lost here. The Kāṇva text has: sa yad etābhir āprībhiḥ punar āpyāyata etābhir enam āpriṇāti tasmād āpriyo nāma. On the Āprī verses, which form the offering-prayers (yājyās) at the fore-offerings of the animal sacrifice, and vary according to different families, see Ait. Br. II, 4; Max Müller, Hist. of A. S. L., p. 463 seq.; Haug, Essays, p. 24r.

4. [The Adhvaryu] having called (on the Āgnīdhra) for the Śraushaṭ, he says (to the Maitrāvaruṇa), 'Prompt (the Hotr̥ to recite to) the kindling-sticks [^egg_466]!' Thus he proceeds with ten fore-offerings,

[^egg_466]: 185:2 See I, 5, 3, 8. The Adhvaryu calls out to the Agnīdh, 'O śrāvaya (make listen)!' The Agnīdh calls out, 'Astu śraushaṭ (yea, may one hear)!' The Adhvaryu calls on the Maitrāvaruṇa, 'Preshya samidhaḥ (prompt as to the kindling-sticks)!' [or, 'Preshya Tanūnapātam or Narāśaṁsam' &c. in the succeeding fore-offerings.] The Maitrāvaruṇa calls out, 'Hotā yakshat samidham [Tanūnapātam, &c.], (let the Hotr̥ pronounce the offering-prayer to the kindling-sticks, &c,!)' Each offering-prayer (Āprī) is introduced  with the formula 'Ye yajāmahe, &c.' See part i, p.148 note. The divine objects of these oblations of ghee are: 1. the Samidhs or kindling-sticks; 2. either Tanūnapāt or Narāśaṁsa; 3. the Iḍas; 4. the Barhis (sacrificial grass on the altar); 5. the gates (of heaven and worshipping ground); 6. Dawn and Night; 7. the two divine Hotr̥s; 8. the three goddesses (Sarasvatī, Iḍā, and Bhāratī); 9. Tvashṭr̥; 10. Vanaspati (the tree, or lord of the forest); 11. the Svāhākr̥tis (calls of 'All-hail,' which at this, the last offering-prayer, are repeated before the names of the principal deities of the sacrifice). For this last fore-offering, see III, 8, 2, 23 seq.

5. He then takes the (svaru) chip of the sacrificial stake, and having anointed both (the slaughtering-knife and the chip) at the top (with ghee) from the guhū-spoon, he touches the forehead of the victim with them, saying (Vāj. S. VI, 11), 'Anointed with ghee, protect ye the animals!' for the chip of the stake is a thunderbolt, and the slaughtering-knife is a thunderbolt, and ghee is a thunderbolt; having thus fitted together the entire thunderbolt [^egg_468] he appoints it the keeper of this (victim), lest the evil spirits should injure it. He again conceals the chip of the stake (under the girding-rope of the stake). In handing the slaughtering-knife to the butcher, he says, 'Be this thine approved edge!' and deposits the two spoons.

[^egg_469]: 186:3 The Hotr̥ recites the triplet, Rig-veda IV, 15, 1-3.

the Agnīdh carries the fire round (the victim). Why he carries the fire round, is that he encircles it (the victim) by means of the fire with an unbroken fence, lest the evil spirits should seize upon it; for Agni is the repeller of the Rakshas; therefore he carries the fire round. He carries it round the place where they cook it (the victim [^egg_470]).

[^egg_470]: 187:1 Sāyaṇa seems to take 'abhipariharati' in the sense of 'he takes it round to the place where they cook.' According to Kāty. VI, 5, 2, 3, the Agnīdh circumambulates thrice from left to right, either the place comprising the victim, the ghee, the slaughtering-place, the sacrificial post, the cātvāla, and Āhavanīya; or only the ghee, the victim, and slaughtering-place. He then throws the firebrand back on the Āhavanīya, and performs the circumambulation as many times in the opposite direction. On the Paryagnikaraṇa, see also part i, p. 45 note.

8. Let him, however, not do this.
