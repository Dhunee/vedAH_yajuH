1. The sacrifice is a man; it is a man for the reason that a man spreads (prepares) it. In being spread it is made just as large [^egg_339] as a man: this is why the sacrifice is a man.

[^egg_339]: 126:2 Yāvat-tāvat would rather seem to mean here 'of corresponding (or relatively the same) proportions' as a man, viz. as the respective sacrificer. 'Sa vai tāyamāno yāvān eva purushas tāvān vidhīyate, purushasyaiva vidhām anu.' Kāṇva rec.

2. The Soma-cart (shed) is no other than his head, and has Vishṇu for its deity [^egg_340]. And because Soma is therein--Soma being havis (material for offering) for the gods--therefore it is called Havirdhāna (receptacle of havis).

Each now drives his cart westward along the south and north sides respectively; and when they are opposite the hall (śāla), they make the carts turn round from left to right; whereupon they drive back to the altar, and place them thereon with the shafts towards the east, near the antaḥpāta ('intermediate' peg, see III, 5, 1, 1), south and north of the 'spine' (cf. p. 112, note 2), each at the distance of one cubit from the latter.

9. Over them, having been turned round (and placed on the altar), they put a mat of reed-grass; or, if he cannot procure a reed-mat, a frame of split cane

made in like manner as a reed-mat. They fasten a front-band (to the posts of the front door [^egg_346]). They enclose (the carts) within two upright hurdles; and lay a (second) reed-mat, or a frame of split cane made in like manner as a reed-mat, behind (the first mat [^egg_347]).

[^egg_346]: 128:1 It is not clear to me whether the arrangements mentioned in this paragraph refer to the carts in the first place, and have then to be repeated after the shed has been erected, or whether, as I think, some of them refer to the shed only. Even at the time of the Kāty. Sūtras there seems to have been some confusion in this respect, and the rules VIII, 4, 7-12 (10-15, in edition) were entirely misunderstood by the commentator. It is, however, certain that the carts were covered with mats, previously to being shifted from the back to the front part of the altar. As regards the shed, it seems to have been constructed in the following way. In front of the carts, as well as behind them, beams are driven into the ground, six on each side, according to Sāyaṇa on T. S. I, 2, 13; the two middle ones, one cubit north and south of the 'spine' respectively, forming a gateway on each side (Kāty. VIII, 4, 24 scholl.). On these two rows of beams other beams are laid, running from south to north, and forming, as it were, the lintels of the gates; and thereon the tie-beams rest (west to east). This frame of timber is to form a square of nine (or ten) cubits. Over the tie-beams three mats of reed-grass(cadis)--measuring nine (or ten) cubits by three (3½)--are spread, from south to north; first the middle one and then the two others, behind and in front of it. Upright hurdles (or reed-mats) are then stretched between the respective corner-posts, so as to form the south and north sides of the shed; and are 'sewn' to the corner-posts. Between the tops of the two front door-posts a band or garland of plaited reed-tufts (or, according to Haug, a bunch of Darbha grass, consisting of dry and green stalks) is hung up, to represent either a fillet or wreath worn on the forehead (?), or as a door-garland.

[^egg_347]: 128:2 This remark would seem to imply that there are only two mats (cf. parags. 23, 24), but perhaps it is merely intended to show that two mats are spread behind and in front of the first mat (i.e. from south to north, and not west to east); not that there are only two mats.

When he says, 'They harness the mind,' he harnesses the mind; and when he says, 'and they harness the thoughts (dhī),' he harnesses speech; for it is thereby [^egg_349] that people seek to make their living in accordance with their respective intelligence (dhī), either by reciting (the Veda), or by readiness of speech, or by songs,--with these two thus harnessed they perform the sacrifice.

It is on this middle board that he is to make the carts stand.

21. The Adhvaryu, having gone round along the north side (of the carts), props the southern cart, with (Vāj. S. V, 18; Rig-veda I, 154, 1), 'Now will I declare the heroic deeds of Vishṇu, who measured out the earthly regions; who propped the upper seat, striding thrice, the wide-stepping! For Vishṇu (I prop) thee!' He fixes the prop in a different place from where (it is fixed) in ordinary practice [^egg_360].

[^egg_360]: 133:1 Sāyaṇa, on Taitt. S. I, 2, 13, remarks:--'The southern and northern parts of the yoke represent the ears of the cart. Through a hole (is effected) the firm tying (of the yoke parts) to the shafts. At the juncture (sandhi) at the (place of) fastening of the southern (part of the yoke) the prop is fixed.' In ordinary practice the prop is put up to support the extreme end of the shafts or pole.

22. The assistant then props the northern cart, with (Vāj. S. V, 19), 'Either from the heaven, O Vishṇu, or from the earth, or from the great, wide airy region, O Vishṇu, fill both thine hands with wealth and bestow on us from the right and the left! For Vishṇu thee!' He fixes the prop in a different place from where (it is fixed) in ordinary practice. The reason why he performs with prayers to Vishṇu is that the Soma-cart belongs to Vishṇu.

23. He then makes (the sacrificer) say, after touching the middle reed-mat [^egg_361] (Vāj. S. V, 20; Rig-veda I, 154, 2), 'Let Vishṇu then be praised for his power, terrible like a wild beast prowling about the mountains, on whose three wide strides all beings abide!' Now that (mat-covering) indeed is his (Vishṇu, the shed's) upper skull-bone [^egg_362]

[^egg_361]: 133:2 See p. 128, note 1.

[^egg_362]: 133:3 Apparently the parietal bone is meant; or perhaps the frontal bone. The Kāṇva text reads: 'He then touches that reed-mat, or  cane-frame, above, with "Let Vishṇu . . ." for that is for him (Vishṇu, the shed) what that skull-bone is up here. And when he says "they abide upon," it is because that rest on the other skull-bones [? adhi hy etad anyeshu kapāleshu kshiyanti!]. Then what two reed-mats there are on the two carts, they indeed are for him what the two skull-bones are here on both sides. And that reed-mat, or cane-frame, which he puts on there behind (or behind that one), that is for him what the skull-bone behind is.'

for thereon, as it were, the other skull-bones rest: this is why he says 'they abide on.'

24. Thereupon he makes him say, after touching the front-band (Vāj. S. V, 2), 'Thou art Vishṇu's fillet;' for it indeed is his fillet. He then makes him say, after touching the two upright hurdles, 'Ye are the corners of Vishṇu's mouth;' for they indeed are the corners of his mouth. Then that mat which is behind there, that indeed is that skull-bone of his here behind (viz. the occiput).

[^wbr_3]: तं नि᳘ष्ठित AB. - The fifth adhyâya is reckoned by Sâyaṇa as containing five brâhmaṇas and accordingly the sixth as having three only.

25. With 'Thou art Vishṇu's sewer [^egg_363],' he sews (the hurdles to the four door posts) with cord by means of a wooden pin. With, 'Thou art Vishṇu's fixed (point) [^egg_364],' he then makes a knot, 'lest it should fall asunder.' That same (knot) he undoes when the work is completed; and thus disease [^egg_365] befalls not either the Adhvaryu or the Sacrificer. The completed (cart-shed) he touches with, 'Thou art Vishṇu's own,' for the Soma-cart (and shed) belongs to Vishṇu.

[^egg_363]: 134:1 Syū, explained by Sāyaṇa as 'thread, cord,' by Mahīdhara as 'needle.'

[^egg_364]: 134:2 ? Dhruvaḥ, the 'firm one,' (? 'pole-star.') The St. Petersburg Dictionary gives the tentative meaning 'knot.' The Taitt. S. reads 'dhruvam.'

[^egg_365]: 134:3 Grāha, lit. 'seizing.' For Varuṇa, whose attribute the knot is, (I, 3, 1, 16), seizing upon men by means of disease; see II, 5, 2, 2.
