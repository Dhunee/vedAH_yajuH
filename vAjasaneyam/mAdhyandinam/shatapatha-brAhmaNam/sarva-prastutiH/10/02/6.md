1. The one hundred and one-fold Prajāpati, doubtless, is the year, and thereto belong days and

nights, half-months, months, and seasons. The days and nights of a month are sixty, and in the month, doubtless, the days and nights of the year are obtained; and there are twenty-four half-months, thirteen months, and three seasons (of four months)--that makes a hundred parts, and the year itself is the one hundred and first part.

6. It is regarding this that it is said in the R̥c (I, 22, 7; Vāj. S. XXX, 4), 'The distributer of wealth, the bright boon, we invoke, Savitr̥, the beholder of men.' And that is the full

 (measure of) life, for it is long, it is unending [^egg_621]; and when people here say, 'May thy life be long! mayest thou reach the full (extent of) life!' it is as much as to say, 'May that, world, may that (immortal light) be thine!'

7. It is Vāc (Speech) that, seeing it, speaks (thus). That same (immortal light), indeed, is to be obtained either by the one hundred and one-fold (altar), or by a life of a hundred years: whosoever builds a one hundred and one-fold (altar), or whosoever lives a hundred years, he, indeed, obtains that immortality. Therefore, whether they know it, or whether they do not, people say, 'The life of a hundred years makes for heaven.' Hence one ought not to yield to his own desire and pass away before (he has attained) the full extent of life, for (such shortening of one's life) does not make for the heavenly world [^egg_622]; and these are indeed the worlds, to wit, the days and nights, the half-moons, moons, and seasons, and the year.

[^egg_622]: 323:2 Literally, 'conducive to the world,' or, perhaps, 'conducive to a place (in yonder world).' Sāyaṇa interprets it by--his death is 'alokyam,' that is, not procuring the world consisting of immortality. Some such meaning as '(such conduct) is not world-winning' seems to be implied by the words which follow.

Only by many sacrifices, indeed, is a single day, or a single night (of life) gained; and only he who builds the one hundred and one-fold (altar), or he who lives a hundred years, is certain of his attaining to that immortal (life). But he, indeed, builds a one hundred and one-fold (altar) who carries him (Ukhya Agni) for a year: hence one should only build (an altar for) such an (Agni) who has been carried for a year.

Cf. II, 3, 1, 3, where, with the Kāṇva, we have to read, 'ilitā hi śere (śerate, K.) saṁjānāḥ'--'for (when the sun has set) those who are at variance with one another lie quiet (together).'
