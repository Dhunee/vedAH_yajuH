2. 'If perchance thou hast built him looking forward, it would be just as if one were to offer food from behind to one sitting with averted face [^egg_789]: he thereby will not receive thy offering.'

[^egg_789]: 391:1 The oblations are offered by the Adhvaryu whilst standing south, or south-west, of the fire, with his face turned towards northeast,--hence Agni, looking eastwards, would not see the food offered him.

8. Now, the Koshas, whilst driving about, once drove up [^egg_794] to an Agni with his head pulled out [^egg_795]. One of them said, 'The head (śiras) means excellence (śrī): he has pulled out his excellence, he will be deprived of his all!' and so indeed it happened to him.

[^egg_794]: 392:3 That is to say, according to Sāyaṇa, whilst going about officiating at sacrifices, they built the altar in that way at some one's house.

[^egg_795]: 392:4 That is, with a head built on to the altar on the front side of the body; see the diagram of the śyenaciti in Burnell's Cat. of Vedic MSS. (1870), p. 29.

Upwards, indeed, he (Agni) is built up, to wit, (in the shape of) the grass-bunch, the clod-bricks, the lotus-leaf, the gold plate and man, the two spoons, the naturally-perforated one, the grass-brick, the Dviyajus, the two Retaḥsic, the Viśvajyotis, the two seasonal bricks, the Ashāḍḥā, and the tortoise; and that fire which is placed on the altar-pile, assuredly, is then most manifestly his (Agni's) head: let him therefore not pull out (the head).
