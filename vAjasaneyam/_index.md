## काण्वपाठः
### कलिङ्गान्ध्रपाठः
Utkala region has a lot of kAnva adhyayees only. This pATha is slightly different from that followed in TN, Mh and Kar & thus represents an ancient divergence within the kANva tradition. Some reciters also preserve exaggerated hastamudra-s like mAdhyaMdina-s & might represent a bridge between the two traditions. Perhaps, mAdhyaMdina was originally recited in manner closer to what is seen in Odisha before it lost intonations.
